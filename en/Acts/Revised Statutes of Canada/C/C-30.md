### *Enforcement of Judgments*


### Article III


**1** Where a judgment has been given by a court of one Contracting State, the judgment creditor may apply in accordance with Article VI to a court of the other Contracting State at any time within a period of six years after the date of the judgment (or, where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings) to have the judgment registered, and on any such application the registering court shall, subject to such simple and rapid procedures as each Contracting State may prescribe and to the other provisions of this Convention, order the judgment to be registered.



**2** In addition to the sum of money payable under the judgment of the original court including interest accrued to the date of registration, the judgment shall be registered for the reasonable costs of and incidental to registration, if any, including the costs of obtaining a certified copy of the judgment from the original court.



**3** If, on an application for the registration of a judgment, it appears to the registering court that the judgment is in respect of different matters and that some, but not all, of the provisions of the judgment are such that if those provisions had been contained in separate judgments those judgments could properly have been registered, the judgment may be registered in respect of the provisions aforesaid but not in respect of any other provisions contained therein.



**4** Subject to the other provisions of this Convention

**(a)** a registered judgment shall, for the purposes of enforcement, be of the same force and effect,



**(b)** proceedings may be taken on it, and



**(c)** the registering court shall have the same control over its enforcement,

as if it had been a judgment originally given in the registering court with effect from the date of registration.

**(c)** the original court is not regarded by the registering court as having jurisdiction;



**(d)** the judgment was obtained by fraud;



**(e)** enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to public policy in the territory of the registering court;



**(f)** the judgment is a judgment of a country or territory other than the territory of origin which has been registered in the original court or has become enforceable in the territory of origin in the same manner as a judgment of that court; or



**(g)** in the view of the registering court the judgment debtor either is entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of that court or was entitled to immunity in the original court and did not submit to its jurisdiction.





**2** The law of the registering court may provide that registration of a judgment may or shall be set aside if

**(a)** the judgment debtor, being the defendant in the original proceedings, either was not served with the process of the original court or did not receive notice of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to defend the proceedings and, in either case, did not appear;



**(b)** another judgment has been given by a court having jurisdiction in the matter in dispute prior to the date of judgment in the original court; or



**(c)** the judgment is not final or an appeal is pending or the judgment debtor is entitled to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal against the judgment in the territory of origin.





**3** If at the date of the application for registration the judgment of the original court has been partly satisfied, the judgment shall be registered only in respect of the balance remaining payable at that date.



**4** A judgment shall not be enforced so long as, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention and the law of the registering court, it is competent for any party to make an application to have the registration of the judgment set aside or, where such an application is made, until the application has been finally determined.



### Article V


**1** For the purposes of Article IV(1)(c) the original court shall be regarded as having jurisdiction if

**(b)** the judgment debtor was plaintiff in, or counterclaimed in, the proceedings in the original court;



**(c)** the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, had before the commencement of the proceedings agreed, in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings, to submit to the jurisdiction of that court or of the courts of the territory of origin;



**(d)** the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, was at the time when the proceedings were instituted habitually resident in, or being a body corporate had its principal place of business in, the territory of origin;



**(e)** the judgment debtor, being a defendant in the original court, had an office or place of business in the territory of origin and the proceedings were in respect of a transaction effected through or at that office or place; or



**(f)** the jurisdiction of the original court is otherwise recognised by the registering court.





**2** Notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of paragraph (1), the original court shall not be regarded as having jurisdiction if

**(a)** the subject matter of the proceedings was immovable property outside the territory of origin; or
