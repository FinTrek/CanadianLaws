**Proof of violation**

### Rules About Violations



**Certain defences not available**

**42** 

- **(1)** A person named in a notice of violation does not have a defence by reason that the person
	- **(a)** exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the violation; or
	- **(b)** reasonably and honestly believed in the existence of facts that, if true, would exonerate the person.

**Common law principles**

- **(2)** Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse in relation to a charge for an offence under this Act applies in respect of a violation to the extent that it is not inconsistent with this Act.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Continuing violation**

**43** A violation that is committed or continued on more than one day constitutes a separate violation for each day on which it is committed or continued.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Violation or offence**

**44** 

- **(1)** Proceeding with any act or omission as a violation under this Act precludes proceeding with it as an offence under this Act, and proceeding with it as an offence under this Act precludes proceeding with it as a violation under this Act.

**Violations not offences**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, a violation is not an offence and, accordingly, section 126 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) does not apply in respect of a violation.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Limitation period**

**45** No notice of violation is to be issued more than two years after the day on which the Minister becomes aware of the acts or omissions that constitute the alleged violation.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





### Reviews



**Right to request review**

**46** A person who is served with a notice of violation may — within 30 days after the day on which it is served or within any longer period that is prescribed by the regulations — make a request to the Minister for a review of the amount of the penalty or the facts of the violation, or both.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Correction or cancellation of notice of violation**

**47** At any time before a request for a review in respect of a notice of violation is received by the Minister, an enforcement officer may cancel the notice of violation or correct an error in it.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Review**

**48** On receipt of a request for a review in respect of a notice of violation, the Minister shall conduct the review.

**Object of review**

**49**

- **(3)** If the Minister determines that the amount of the penalty was not determined in accordance with the regulations, the Minister shall correct it.

**Responsibility**

- **(4)** If the Minister determines that the person who requested the review committed the violation, that person is liable to the penalty as set out in the determination.

**Determination final**

- **(5)** A determination made under this section is final and binding and, except for judicial review under the [Federal Courts Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-7.md), is not subject to appeal or to review by any court.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Burden of proof**

**50** If the facts of a violation are reviewed, the enforcement officer who issued the notice of violation shall establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the person named in it committed the violation identified in it.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





### Responsibility



**Payment**

**51** If a person pays the penalty set out in a notice of violation, the person is considered to have committed the violation and proceedings in respect of it are ended.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Failure to act**

**52** A person that neither pays the penalty within the period set out in the notice of violation — nor requests a review within the period referred to in section 46 — is considered to have committed the violation and is liable to the penalty.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





### Recovery of Penalties



**Debts to Her Majesty**

**53** 

- **(1)** A penalty constitutes a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Limitation period**

- **(2)** No proceedings to recover the debt are to be instituted more than five years after the day on which the debt becomes payable.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





**Certificate**

**54** 

- **(1)** The Minister may issue a certificate of non-payment certifying the unpaid amount of any debt referred to in subsection 53(1).

**Registration**

- **(2)** Registration in any court of competent jurisdiction of a certificate of non-payment has the same effect as a judgment of that court for a debt of the amount specified in the certificate and all related registration costs.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.





### General



**Authenticity of documents**

**55** In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a document that appears to be a notice issued under subsection 41(1) is presumed to be authentic and is proof of its contents in any proceeding in respect of a violation.
> 2014, c. 2, s. 77.
