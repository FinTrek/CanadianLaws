	- **(b)** where the refund of tax, calculated for the purposes of this paragraph without reference to any interest on the overpayment or payment making up the refund, exceeds by ten dollars or more the amount estimated to be the refund of tax, the discounter, forthwith after receipt of the refund, pays or makes every reasonable effort to pay to the client the full amount of the excess and, in the event that the excess is not so paid within thirty days thereafter, forthwith remits the excess, together with a true copy of the notice referred to in paragraph 5(b), to the Receiver General to be held on account of any future tax liability of the client or to be paid to the client on application by the client to the Minister of National Revenue.
