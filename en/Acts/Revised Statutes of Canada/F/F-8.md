- **B** is 50% of the amount obtained by subtracting, for the revenue source referred to in paragraph (e) of the definition revenue source in subsection 3.5(1), the average annual per capita revenue to be equalized for that province for that fiscal year from the average annual per capita national revenue to be equalized for that fiscal year, and
- **C** is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year, and
	- **(b)** the amount determined by the formula

- **(a)** the amount of the fiscal equalization payment that would be computed for that province for that fiscal year in accordance with subsection 3.2(1) — or subsection 3.2(2) if the election described in that subsection is made — if, in computing the amount of that payment, that province’s revenue base in respect of the revenue source referred to in paragraph (d) of the definition ***revenue source*** in subsection 3.5(1) were determined in the manner set out in the regulations made for the purposes of this section

- **C** is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year.

**Re-calculation**

```
A × (1 + B)

- **B** is the average of the annual rates of growth of the nominal gross domestic product of Canada, as determined by the Minister, for the calendar year that ends during the fiscal year in question and for the two previous calendar years.

**Calculation**

- **(6)** If the aggregate of the fiscal equalization payments that would be paid for a fiscal year, if the amounts of those payments were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 as if no province had made an election under subsection 3.2(2), exceeds the amount determined under subsection (5), the fiscal equalization payment that may be paid to a province for that fiscal year determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 shall be reduced by the amount determined by the formula
```
A × B
```
where
- **A** is the lesser of the per capita equalization payment for that province for that fiscal year and the per capita reduction; and
- **B** is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year.

**Per capita calculation**

- **(7)** For the purposes of subsection (6), the Minister shall determine the per capita reduction for a fiscal year and shall, in making that determination, ensure that the aggregate of the reductions referred to in that subsection is equal to the amount determined by the formula
```
A – B
```

**Adjustment payment**

- **(8)** If the aggregate of the fiscal equalization payments that would be paid for a fiscal year, if the amounts of those payments were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 as if no province had made an election under subsection 3.2(2), is less than the amount determined under subsection (5), there may be paid to a province for that fiscal year an adjustment payment that is,
	- **(a)** in the case of a province to which a fiscal equalization payment would be paid for that fiscal year, if the amount of that payment were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2, the amount determined by the formula
```
A × B
```
where
- **A** is the per capita adjustment for that fiscal year, and
- **B** is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year; and
	- **(b)** in any other case, the greater of zero and the amount determined by the formula
```
(C + D – E) × F
```
where
- **C** is the per capita pre-adjustment equalized fiscal capacity for that fiscal year of the province that has the greatest per capita pre-adjustment equalized fiscal capacity for that fiscal year of the provinces referred to in paragraph (a),

```
(A - B) × C
```
where

	- **(a)** the amount determined by the following formula would be the same with respect to every province that would receive a fiscal equalization payment:
```
A + (B / C)
```
where
- **A** is the aggregate of the average annual per capita yield in that province for each revenue source for that fiscal year,
- **B** is the amount of the fiscal equalization payment that would be received by that province for that fiscal year, and

	- **(b)** any legislation that is required to give effect to the elimination is enacted after March 18, 2007 and before January 2, 2011.

**Meaning of elimination**

- **(2)** For the purposes of this Part, a capital tax is considered to be eliminated if
	- **(a)** under the law of the province, the tax ceases before January 2, 2011 to be imposed on all corporations, except that the tax may continue to be imposed on any corporation that is exempt from tax under any of paragraphs 149(1)(d) to (d.4) of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md) on all of its taxable income; or
	- **(b)** in the case where the tax is imposed only on financial institutions, the law under which the tax is imposed is amended, before January 2, 2011, to replace the tax with a new capital tax imposed only on financial institutions that meets the following criteria:
		- **(i)** no financial institution becomes subject to the new capital tax that was not subject to the replaced tax,
		- **(ii)** every financial institution on which the new capital tax is imposed must be permitted to reduce the amount of the new capital tax payable by it for a taxation year by the amount of income tax payable by it to the province for the year and, if the amount of income tax so payable exceeds the amount of the new capital tax so payable, the financial institution must be permitted to apply the amount of the excess to reduce capital tax payable by it in other taxation years in a manner satisfactory to the Minister, and
		- **(iii)** the Minister is satisfied that the total amount of revenue that would be raised by the new capital tax from financial institutions if there were no reduction for income tax payable is intended to be broadly commensurate with the total amount of revenue raised from those financial institutions by the province’s income tax.

- **(3)** If a province imposes a capital tax that applies to financial institutions as well as corporations that are not financial institutions, the capital tax is deemed to be two separate capital taxes for the purposes of this Part.

- **(3)** After finalized information that is consistent with a province’s public accounts becomes available so as to enable the Minister to make a final determination of the amount under subsection (1) in respect of a period, the Minister shall do so and reconcile the final determination with any preliminary payment paid to the province. If the amount of the final determination is greater than the preliminary payment, the Minister shall, without delay, pay the difference to the province.
