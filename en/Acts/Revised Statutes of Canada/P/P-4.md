**Factors for determining whether agreement is commercial in nature**

- **(2)** In determining whether the agreement is commercial in nature, the Federal Court must take into account
	- **(a)** the need for the holder of the authorization to make a reasonable return sufficient to sustain a continued participation in humanitarian initiatives;
	- **(b)** the ordinary levels of profitability, in Canada, of commercial agreements involving pharmaceutical products, as defined in paragraph 1(a) of the General Council Decision; and

	- **(a)** terminating the authorization; or
	- **(b)** requiring the holder to pay, in addition to the royalty otherwise required to be paid, an amount that the Federal Court considers adequate to compensate the patentee for the commercial use of the patent.

**Additional order**

- **(4)** If the Federal Court makes an order terminating the authorization, the Federal Court may also, if it considers it appropriate to do so, make an order, on any terms that it considers appropriate,
	- **(a)** requiring the holder to deliver to the patentee any of the product to which the authorization relates remaining in the holder’s possession as though the holder had been determined to have been infringing a patent; or
	- **(b)** with the consent of the patentee, requiring the holder to export any of the product to which the authorization relates remaining in the holder’s possession to the country or WTO Member named in the authorization.

**Restriction**

- **(5)** The Federal Court may not make an order under subsection (3) if, under the protection of a confidentiality order made by the Court, the holder of the authorization submits to a Court-supervised audit and that audit establishes that the average price of the product manufactured under the authorization does not exceed an amount equal to the direct supply cost of the product plus 15 per cent of that direct supply cost.

**Definitions**

- **(6)** The following definitions apply in this section.

***average price*** means

- **(1.1)** Subsection (1) also applies in the case where the original patent is set out in a certificate of supplementary protection and the original patent’s term has expired, except that in that case the issuance of the new patent, whose term remains expired, is for the purpose of establishing the rights, privileges and liberties granted under the certificate.

**Effect of new patent**

- **(2)** The surrender referred to in subsection (1) takes effect only on the issue of the new patent, and the new patent and the amended description and specification have the same effect in law, on the trial of any action thereafter commenced for any cause subsequently accruing, as if the amended description and specification had been originally filed in their corrected form before the issue of the original patent, but, in so far as the claims of the original and reissued patents are identical, the surrender does not affect any action pending at the time of reissue or abate any cause of action then existing, and the reissued patent to the extent that its claims are identical with the original patent constitutes a continuation thereof and has effect continuously from the date of the original patent.

	- **(b)** in the specification, claimed that the patentee or the person through whom the patentee claims was the inventor of any material or substantial part of the invention patented of which the patentee was not the inventor, and to which the patentee had no lawful right,
the patentee may, on payment of a prescribed fee, make a disclaimer of the parts that the patentee does not claim to hold by virtue of the patent or a transfer of the patent.

- **(6)** A patent shall, after disclaimer as provided in this section, be deemed to be valid for such material and substantial part of the invention, definitely distinguished from other parts thereof claimed without right, as is not disclaimed and is truly the invention of the disclaimant, and the disclaimant is entitled to maintain an action or suit in respect of that part accordingly.

**53** 

- **(1)** A patent is void if any material allegation in the petition of the applicant in respect of the patent is untrue, or if the specification and drawings contain more or less than is necessary for obtaining the end for which they purport to be made, and the omission or addition is wilfully made for the purpose of misleading.

**Exception**

- **(2)** Where it appears to a court that the omission or addition referred to in subsection (1) was an involuntary error and it is proved that the patentee is entitled to the remainder of his patent, the court shall render a judgment in accordance with the facts, and shall determine the costs, and the patent shall be held valid for that part of the invention described to which the patentee is so found to be entitled.

## Infringement



**Jurisdiction of courts**

**54** 

- **(1)** An action for the infringement of a patent may be brought in that court of record that, in the province in which the infringement is said to have occurred, has jurisdiction, pecuniarily, to the amount of the damages claimed and that, with relation to the other courts of the province, holds its sittings nearest to the place of residence or of business of the defendant, and that court shall decide the case and determine the costs, and assumption of jurisdiction by the court is of itself sufficient proof of jurisdiction.

- **(2)** A person is liable to pay reasonable compensation to a patentee and to all persons claiming under the patentee for any damage sustained by the patentee or by any of those persons by reason of any act on the part of that person, after the specification contained in the application for the patent became open to public inspection, in English or French, under section 10 and before the grant of the patent, that would have constituted an infringement of the patent if the patent had been granted on the day the specification became open to public inspection, in English or French, under that section.

- **(2)** The exclusive rights under a patent shall be deemed to have been abused in any of the following circumstances:
	- **(a) and (b)** [Repealed, 1993, c. 44, s. 196]
	- **(c)** if the demand for the patented article in Canada is not being met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms;
	- **(d)** if, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a licence or licences on reasonable terms, the trade or industry of Canada or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in Canada, or the establishment of any new trade or industry in Canada, is prejudiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence or licences should be granted;
	- **(e)** if any trade or industry in Canada, or any person or class of persons engaged therein, is unfairly prejudiced by the conditions attached by the patentee, whether before or after the passing of this Act, to the purchase, hire, licence or use of the patented article or to the using or working of the patented process; or
	- **(f)** if it is shown that the existence of the patent, being a patent for an invention relating to a process involving the use of materials not protected by the patent or for an invention relating to a substance produced by such a process, has been utilized by the patentee so as unfairly to prejudice in Canada the manufacture, use or sale of any materials.

- **(3) and (4)** [Repealed, 1993, c. 44, s. 196]

**Definition of patented article**

- **(5)** For the purposes of this section, the expression ***patented article*** includes articles made by a patented process.

**Powers of Commissioner in cases of abuse**

**66** 

- **(1)** On being satisfied that a case of abuse of the exclusive rights under a patent has been established, the Commissioner may exercise any of the following powers as he may deem expedient in the circumstances:
	- **(a)** he may order the grant to the applicant of a licence on such terms as the Commissioner may think expedient, including a term precluding the licensee from importing into Canada any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the patentee or persons claiming under him, would be an infringement of the patent, and in that case the patentee and all licensees for the time being shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against that importation;
	- **(b)** [Repealed, 1993, c. 44, s. 197]
	- **(c)** if the Commissioner is satisfied that the exclusive rights have been abused in the circumstances specified in paragraph 65(2)(f), he may order the grant of licences to the applicant and to such of his customers, and containing such terms, as the Commissioner may think expedient;
	- **(d)** if the Commissioner is satisfied that the objects of this section and section 65 cannot be attained by the exercise of any of the foregoing powers, the Commissioner shall order the patent to be revoked, either forthwith or after such reasonable interval as may be specified in the order, unless in the meantime such conditions as may be specified in the order with a view to attaining the objects of this section and section 65 are fulfilled, and the Commissioner may, on reasonable cause shown in any case, by subsequent order extend the interval so specified, but the Commissioner shall not make an order for revocation which is at variance with any treaty, convention, arrangement, or engagement with any other country to which Canada is a party; or
	- **(e)** if the Commissioner is of opinion that the objects of this section and section 65 will be best attained by not making an order under the provisions of this section, he may make an order refusing the application and dispose of any question as to costs thereon as he thinks just.

**Proceedings to prevent infringement**

- **(2)** A licensee under paragraph (1)(a) is entitled to call on the patentee to take proceedings to prevent infringement of the patent, and if the patentee refuses or neglects to do so within two months after being so called on, the licensee may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as though he were the patentee, making the patentee a defendant, but a patentee added as defendant is not liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings.

- **(3)** [Repealed, 2017, c. 6, s. 41]

**Considerations by which Commissioner to be guided**

- **(4)** In settling the terms of a licence under paragraph (1)(a), the Commissioner shall be guided as far as possible by the following considerations:

### Certificate of Supplementary Protection



**Issue of certificate**

**113** The Minister shall issue, to the patentee, a certificate of supplementary protection for the patented invention set out in the patentee’s application if, on the day of issuance,
- **(a)** the Minister is satisfied that all requirements set out in section 106 are met;
- **(b)** the applicable period referred to in subsection 106(3) for filing the application has ended;
- **(c)** there is no other pending application that sets out the same authorization for sale and that has priority over, or the same priority as, the application; and
- **(d)** any court proceedings, brought under section 110 with respect to the application or to another pending application that sets out the same authorization for sale and that has priority over, or the same priority as, the application, have been finally disposed of.
> 2017, c. 6, s. 59





**Contents of certificate**

**114** A certificate of supplementary protection shall set out
- **(a)** the number, as recorded in the Patent Office, of the patent set out in the application;
- **(b)** the medicinal ingredient or combination of medicinal ingredients set out in the application;
- **(c)** a statement as to whether the certificate relates to use in humans or to veterinary use;
- **(d)** the number of the authorization for sale set out in the application; and
- **(e)** the day on which the certificate’s term begins and the day on which the term ends, as determined under section 116.
> 2017, c. 6, s. 59





**Scope of supplementary protection**

**115** 

- **(1)** The issuance of a certificate of supplementary protection grants the certificate’s holder and their legal representatives, during the certificate’s term, the same rights, privileges and liberties that are granted by the patent set out in the certificate, but only with respect to the making, constructing, using and selling of any drug that contains the medicinal ingredient, or combination of medicinal ingredients, set out in the certificate, by itself or in addition to any other medicinal ingredient.

**No infringement — export**

- **(2)** Despite subsection (1), it is not an infringement of the certificate of supplementary protection for any person to make, construct, use or sell the medicinal ingredient or combination of medicinal ingredients for the purpose of export from Canada.
> 2017, c. 6, s. 59





**Validity**

**116** 

- **(1)** After the certificate is issued, it shall, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, be valid and avail the holder and the holder’s legal representatives for its term.

**Taking effect**

- **(2)** A certificate of supplementary protection takes effect on the expiry of the term under section 44, without taking into account section 46, of the patent set out in the certificate, but the certificate takes effect only if the patent remains valid until, and not void before, the expiry of that term.

**Calculation of term**

- **(3)** The certificate’s term is calculated by subtracting five years from the period beginning on the filing date of the application for the patent and ending on the day on which the authorization for sale set out in the certificate is issued, but in any event is for a maximum of two years.

**Reduction in period**

- **(4)** Despite subsection (3), if the person to whom the authorization for sale set out in the certificate is issued is also the patentee, the Minister may, if he or she is of the opinion that that person’s failure to act resulted in a period of unjustified delay in the process of obtaining the authorization for sale, reduce the term of the certificate when issuing it by the amount of that period.

**Never takes effect**

- **(5)** A certificate of supplementary protection that has been issued never takes effect if the calculation of its term, including any reduction under subsection (3), produces a result of zero or a negative value.
> 2017, c. 6, s. 59





**Revocation of certificate**

**117** The Minister shall revoke a certificate of supplementary protection in the prescribed circumstances.
> 2017, c. 6, s. 59





### Transfer



**Transfer of patent**

**118** 

- **(1)** Despite subsection 49(1), a certificate of supplementary protection, or an application for one, is not transferable other than by the transfer of the patent, or part of the patent, that is set out in the certificate or application.

**Whole of patent**

- **(2)** If the whole of the patent is transferred, the certificate or application is transferred accordingly.

**Part of patent**

- **(3)** If part of the patent is transferred, any part of the certificate or application — including, as the case may be, the whole of it — that corresponds to the transferred part of the patent is transferred accordingly.

**For greater certainty**

- **(4)** For greater certainty, the transfer of part of an application for a certificate of supplementary protection does not result in its division into more than one application.
> 2017, c. 6, ss. 59, 135





### Administrative Matters



**Applications, fees and documents**

**119** Applications, fees and documents relating to certificates of supplementary protection shall be submitted to the Minister.

**Inspection by public**

**120**

**Issuance of patent under section 47**

**122** 

- **(1)** If a patent set out in a certificate of supplementary protection or in a pending application for such a certificate is surrendered, and a new patent is issued, under section 47, the holder of the certificate or the applicant shall, before the end of the prescribed period that begins on the day on which the new patent is issued, provide the Minister with written notice of the number, as recorded in the Patent Office, of the new patent to which the certificate or application relates.

**One patent**

- **(2)** If more than one new patent is issued under section 47, the holder of the certificate or the applicant shall provide the number for only one of the new patents.

**New certificate**

- **(3)** If notice is provided under subsection (1) by a holder of a certificate, the Minister shall issue a new certificate of supplementary protection, setting out the new patent number, to replace the original certificate. The new certificate’s term is the then unexpired term of the original certificate.

**Effect of new certificate**

- **(4)** The new certificate is deemed to have been issued on the day on which the new patent is issued. The original certificate and the new certificate have the same effect in law, in any action commenced after the issuance of the new certificate for any cause accruing after that issuance, as if the new patent had been set out in the original certificate; however, insofar as the claims of the new patent and the original patent are identical, the issuance of the new certificate does not affect any action pending at the time of the issuance of the new certificate or abate any cause of action that existed at that time and the new certificate constitutes a continuation of the original certificate and has effect accordingly.

**Application**

- **(5)** If notice is provided under subsection (1) by an applicant for a pending application, the Minister shall
	- **(a)** amend the application to set out the new patent number; and
	- **(b)** provide written notice of the amendment to any other applicant referred to in section 109 with respect to the application.

**Effect of amendment to application**

- **(6)** The amended application has the same effect, for the purposes of sections 106 to 113, as if the pending application had been originally filed in its amended form.
> 2017, c. 6, s. 59

**127** 

- **(1)** The Commissioner may, in respect of application under section 65, exercise any of the powers under any of paragraphs 66(1)(a), (d) and (e) with respect to an issued certificate of supplementary protection if he or she is satisfied that a case of abuse of the exclusive rights under the patent that is set out in the certificate has been established.

**Abuse — application to Commissioner**

- **(2)** The Attorney General of Canada or an interested person may, at any time after a certificate of supplementary protection takes effect and after the expiry of three years from the date of the grant of the patent set out in the certificate, apply to the Commissioner alleging that there has been an abuse of the exclusive rights granted under a certificate of supplementary protection issued with respect to that patent and asking for relief under this Act.

- **(3)** The exclusive rights under a certificate of supplementary protection are abused in any of the following circumstances:
	- **(a)** the demand in Canada for a drug that contains the medicinal ingredient or a combination of the medicinal ingredients set out in the certificate is not being met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms;
	- **(b)** by reason of the refusal of the certificate’s holder to grant a licence or licences on reasonable terms, the trade or industry of Canada or the trade of any person or class of persons trading in Canada, or the establishment of any new trade or industry in Canada, is prejudiced, and it is in the public interest that a licence or licences should be granted;
	- **(c)** any trade or industry in Canada, or any person or class of persons engaged in such a trade or industry, is unfairly prejudiced by the conditions attached by the certificate’s holder to the purchase, hire, licence, use or working of the invention protected by the certificate.
