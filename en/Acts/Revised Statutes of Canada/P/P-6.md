**Determination of exceptional incapacity**

- **(2)** Without restricting the generality of paragraph (1)(b), in determining whether the incapacity suffered by a member of the forces is exceptional, account shall be taken of the extent to which the disability for which the member is receiving a pension has left the member in a helpless condition or in continuing pain and discomfort, has resulted in loss of enjoyment of life or has shortened the life expectancy of the member.

**Payment of allowance on death of member**

- **(5)** Where a member of the forces who has been awarded an exceptional incapacity allowance under this section dies, the exceptional incapacity allowance shall, if that member was a member to whom an additional pension was, at the time of death, payable in respect of the member’s spouse, common-law partner or child living with the member, be paid for a period of one year commencing on the first day of the month following the month of the death, to the survivor, if living, or, if not living, equally to any of the member’s children otherwise pensionable under this Act.
