# Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act

**R.S.C. 1985, c. A-14**


----------




**Preamble**

WHEREAS a task force was established by the Government of Canada to study the Atlantic Fisheries with a view to recommending means of establishing and maintaining viable fishery enterprises on the Atlantic coast of Canada taking into account the economic and social development of the provinces concerned;

AND WHEREAS the Government of Canada adopted the recommendations of the task force with respect to objectives of Atlantic Fisheries policy to the effect, in order of priority, first, that the Atlantic fishing industry be economically viable on an on-going basis, second, that employment in that industry be maximized subject to the constraint that those employed receive a reasonable income and third, to the extent that this objective is consistent with the first two objectives and with Canada’s international treaty obligations, that fish on the Atlantic coast of Canada be harvested and processed by Canadians;

AND WHEREAS the Government of Canada, recognizing that the Atlantic fish stocks are a vital national resource but that the present condition of the fishing industry does not permit the fullest and most efficient utilization of that resource, is of the opinion that it is urgently required and in the public interest that fishery enterprises be restructured;

AND WHEREAS representatives of the Government of Canada have held discussions with others with respect to the means by which such restructuring may be effected;



NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
