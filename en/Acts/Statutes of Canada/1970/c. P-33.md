## Calculation of Adjustment



**Calculation of adjustment**

**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to this Act, the annual rate of the pension payable to a recipient whose pension does not exceed the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which that recipient belongs is increased by an amount equal to the lesser of
	- **(a)** the amount obtained by multiplying
		- **(i)** the annual rate of the pension payable to the recipient, or
		- **(ii)** the annual rate specified in column 1 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs,
whichever is the lesser, by the figure in columns 2 to 7 of Schedule II that is appropriate to the salary basis on which the pension of the recipient is calculated and is opposite the latest period of service of the employee, to or in respect of whom the pension is payable, as set out in column 1 of the said Schedule, that was used to calculate the pension; and
	- **(b)** an amount equal to the amount remaining after subtracting the annual rate of the pension payable to that recipient from the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs.

**Pension deemed to be calculated on ten year average salary basis**

- **(2)** Where the pension of a recipient was calculated on the average annual salary received by the employee to or in respect of whom the pension is payable during the period of pensionable service to that employee’s credit, but would, if that employee had ten years or more pensionable service, have been calculated on the basis of the average annual salary received by him during a ten year period, the pension of that recipient shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be calculated on a ten year average salary basis.
> 1959, c. 32, s. 3.





**Person in receipt of more than one pension**

**4** Where a recipient is in receipt of more than one pension and the total annual rate of the pensions payable to that recipient exceeds the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, no increase shall be made pursuant to this Act in any of the pensions payable to that recipient.
> 1959, c. 32, s. 4.





**Rules applicable where person is in receipt of two pensions**

**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), where a recipient is in receipt of two pensions and the total annual rate of both pensions does not exceed the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, each pension of that recipient shall be increased in accordance with the following rules:
	- **(a)** if the annual rate of the first pension of the recipient is equal to or greater than the annual rate specified in column 1 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, the annual rate of the first pension of that recipient shall be increased in accordance with the formula set out in section 3, and no increase shall be made in the annual rate of the second pension of the recipient;
	- **(b)** if the aggregate of the annual rate of the first and second pensions of the recipient is less than the annual rate specified in column 1 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, the annual rate of each of the pensions of that recipient shall be increased in accordance with the formula set out in section 3; and
	- **(c)** if the annual rate of the first pension of the recipient is less than the annual rate specified in column 1 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, but the aggregate of the annual rate of the first and second pensions of the recipient exceeds the annual rate specified in column 1 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, the annual rate of each of the pensions of that recipient shall be increased in accordance with the formula set out in section 3, and for the purposes of this paragraph the annual rate of the second pension shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the resultant obtained by subtracting from the annual rate specified in column 1 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs, the annual rate of the first pension of the recipient.

**Maximum increase**

- **(2)** No increase shall be made pursuant to this section in the pension payable to a recipient so that the aggregate of the annual rate of both pensions of that recipient and the increases thereto exceeds the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs.

**Definitions**

- **(3)** In this section

***first pension*** means the pension payable to a recipient and calculated in respect of a period of service that is earlier in time than the latest period of service in respect of which the other pension payable to that recipient is calculated; (*première pension*)

***second pension*** means a pension payable to a recipient other than a first pension. (*seconde pension*)
> 1959, c. 32, s. 5.





**Person in receipt of two or more pensions**

**6** Where a recipient is in receipt of more than two pensions and the total annual rate of all the pensions payable to him does not exceed the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which that recipient belongs, each pension of that recipient shall be increased by such amount as the Treasury Board determines, but the aggregate of the increases in the pensions payable to that recipient shall not exceed an annual amount equal to the lesser of
- **(a)** the maximum annual increase specified in column 3 of Schedule III for the class to which that recipient belongs; and
- **(b)** the amount remaining after subtracting the aggregate of the annual rate of all the pensions payable to that recipient from the annual rate specified in column 2 of Schedule III for the class to which the recipient belongs.
> 1959, c. 32, s. 6.





**Person in receipt of two or more pensions as employee and widow**

**7** 

- **(1)** Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where a recipient as an employee and as a widow of an employee is in receipt of two or more pensions
	- **(a)** if the total rate of all the pensions payable to that recipient exceeds three thousand dollars, no increase shall be made in the annual rate of any of the pensions payable to that recipient; and
	- **(b)** if the total rate of all the pensions payable to that recipient does not exceed three thousand dollars, each pension shall, subject to subsection (2), be increased in accordance with the formula set out in section 3.

**Maximum increase**

- **(2)** The aggregate of all increases made in the pensions of a recipient described in subsection (1) shall not exceed an annual amount equal to the lesser of
	- **(a)** the amount remaining after subtracting from three thousand dollars the aggregate of the annual amount of the pensions payable to the recipient; and
	- **(b)** an amount determined by the Treasury Board but in no case exceeding six hundred and forty dollars.
