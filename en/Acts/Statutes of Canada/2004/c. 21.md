## Purpose and Principles



**Purpose**

**3** The purpose of this Act is to enhance public safety and to contribute to the administration of justice and the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community by enabling offenders to serve their sentences in the country of which they are citizens or nationals.
> 2004, c. 21, s. 3; 2012, c. 1, s. 135.





**Dual criminality**

**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (3), a transfer is not available unless the Canadian offender’s conduct would have constituted a criminal offence if it had occurred in Canada at the time the Minister receives the request for a transfer.

**Conduct determinative**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, it is not relevant whether the conduct referred to in subsection (1) is named, defined or characterized by the foreign entity in the same way as it is in Canada.

**Exception — children**

- **(3)** A transfer is available to a Canadian offender who, at the time the offence was committed, was a child within the meaning of the [Youth Criminal Justice Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2002/c.%201.md) even if their conduct would not have constituted a criminal offence if it had occurred in Canada at that time. That offender may not be detained in Canada.




**Effect of transfer**

**5** 

- **(1)** A transfer may not have the effect of increasing a sentence imposed by a foreign entity or of invalidating a guilty verdict rendered, or a sentence imposed, by a foreign entity. The verdict and the sentence, if any, are not subject to any appeal or other form of review in Canada.

**Evidence**

- **(2)** A document supplied by a foreign entity that sets out a finding of guilt and a sentence, if any, and purports to be signed by a judicial official or a director of a place of confinement in the foreign entity is proof of the facts alleged, in the absence of evidence to the contrary and without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed it.




## Minister



**Administration of Act**

**6** 

- **(1)** The Minister is responsible for the administration of this Act.

**Request for transfer**

**7** A person may not be transferred under a treaty, or an administrative arrangement entered into under section 31 or 32, unless a request is made, in writing, to the Minister.

		- **(i)** inform them, in writing, of that obligation and of sections 4 to 7.1 of that Act and sections 490.031 and 490.0311 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), and

**Purpose and principles**

- **(2)** In determining whether to consent to a transfer, the provincial authority shall take into account the purpose and principles of this Act.




**Factors — Canadian offenders**

**10** 

- **(1)** In determining whether to consent to the transfer of a Canadian offender, the Minister may consider the following factors:
	- **(a)** whether, in the Minister’s opinion, the offender’s return to Canada will constitute a threat to the security of Canada;
	- **(b)** whether, in the Minister’s opinion, the offender’s return to Canada will endanger public safety, including
		- **(i)** the safety of any person in Canada who is a victim, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the [Corrections and Conditional Release Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2020.md), of an offence committed by the offender,
		- **(ii)** the safety of any member of the offender’s family, in the case of an offender who has been convicted of an offence against a family member, or
		- **(iii)** the safety of any child, in the case of an offender who has been convicted of a sexual offence involving a child;
	- **(c)** whether, in the Minister’s opinion, the offender is likely to continue to engage in criminal activity after the transfer;
	- **(d)** whether, in the Minister’s opinion, the offender left or remained outside Canada with the intention of abandoning Canada as their place of permanent residence;
	- **(e)** whether, in the Minister’s opinion, the foreign entity or its prison system presents a serious threat to the offender’s security or human rights;
	- **(f)** whether the offender has social or family ties in Canada;
	- **(g)** the offender’s health;
	- **(h)** whether the offender has refused to participate in a rehabilitation or reintegration program;
	- **(i)** whether the offender has accepted responsibility for the offence for which they have been convicted, including by acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community;
	- **(j)** the manner in which the offender will be supervised, after the transfer, while they are serving their sentence;
	- **(k)** whether the offender has cooperated, or has undertaken to cooperate, with a law enforcement agency; or
	- **(l)** any other factor that the Minister considers relevant.

**Factors — Canadian and foreign offenders**

- **(2)** In determining whether to consent to the transfer of a Canadian or foreign offender, the Minister may consider the following factors:
	- **(a)** whether, in the Minister’s opinion, the offender will, after the transfer, commit a terrorism offence or criminal organization offence within the meaning of section 2 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md); and
	- **(b)** whether the offender was previously transferred under this Act or the [Transfer of Offenders Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/T/T-15.md), chapter T-15 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985.

**Additional factor — Canadian young persons**

- **(3)** In determining whether to consent to the transfer of a Canadian offender who is a young person within the meaning of the [Youth Criminal Justice Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2002/c.%201.md), the Minister and the relevant provincial authority shall consider the best interests of the young person.

**Primary consideration — Canadian children**

- **(4)** In determining whether to consent to the transfer of a Canadian offender who is a child within the meaning of the [Youth Criminal Justice Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2002/c.%201.md), the primary consideration of the Minister and the relevant provincial authority is to be the best interests of the child.
> 2004, c. 21, s. 10; 2012, c. 1, s. 136.





**Writing**

**11** 

- **(1)** A consent, a refusal of consent or a withdrawal of consent is to be given in writing.

**Reasons**

- **(2)** If the Minister does not consent to a transfer, the Minister shall give reasons.




**Consent voluntary**

**12** The Minister shall take all reasonable steps to determine whether an offender’s consent has been given voluntarily.




## Continued Enforcement and Adaptation



**Continued enforcement**

**13** The enforcement of a Canadian offender’s sentence is to be continued in accordance with the laws of Canada as if the offender had been convicted and their sentence imposed by a court in Canada.




**Adaptation**

**14** Subject to subsection 17(1) and section 18, if, at the time the Minister receives a request for the transfer of a Canadian offender, the sentence imposed by the foreign entity is longer than the maximum sentence provided for in Canadian law for the equivalent offence, the Canadian offender is to serve only the shorter sentence.




**Equivalent offence**

**15** For the purposes of the application of any Act of Parliament to a Canadian offender, the Minister shall identify the criminal offence that, at the time the Minister receives their request for a transfer, is equivalent to the offence of which the Canadian offender was convicted.




## Probation



**Deemed probation order**

**16** A foreign sentence that consists of a period of supervision, other than by reason of conditional release — or a period of supervision that is, other than by reason of a conditional release, an element of a foreign sentence of imprisonment of less than two years — is deemed to be a probation order under section 731 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), to a maximum of three years, or under paragraph 42(2)(k) of the [Youth Criminal Justice Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2002/c.%201.md), to a maximum of two years.

## Sentence Calculation



**Where committed**

**21** Subject to section 20, a Canadian offender who was detained in a foreign entity is to be detained in Canada in
- **(a)** a prison if they were sentenced to imprisonment for less than two years; or
- **(b)** a penitentiary if they were sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more.




**Credit towards completion of sentence**

**22** 

- **(1)** The length of a Canadian offender’s sentence equals the length of the sentence imposed by the foreign entity minus any time that was, before their transfer, recognized by the foreign entity as a reduction, other than time spent in confinement after the sentence was imposed.

**Credit for time spent in confinement**

- **(2)** The time that a Canadian offender spent in confinement, after the sentence was imposed and before their transfer, is subtracted from the length of the sentence determined in accordance with subsection (1). The resulting period constitutes the period that the offender is to serve on the sentence.




**Eligibility for parole — general**

**23** Subject to sections 19 and 24, a Canadian offender who is transferred to Canada is eligible for full parole on the day on which they have served, commencing on the day on which they commenced serving their sentence, the lesser of seven years and one third of the length of the sentence as determined under subsection 22(1).




**Eligibility for parole — murder**

**24** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections 17(2) and 19(1), if a Canadian offender was sentenced to imprisonment for life for an offence that, if it had been committed in Canada, would have constituted murder within the meaning of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), their full parole ineligibility period is 10 years. If, in the Minister’s opinion, the documents supplied by the foreign entity show that the circumstances in which the offence was committed were such that, if it had been committed in Canada after July 26, 1976, it would have been first degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of that Act, the full parole ineligibility period is
	- **(a)** 15 years, if the offence was committed before the day on which paragraph 745.6(1)(a.1) of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) comes into force; or
	- **(b)** 25 years, if the offence was committed on or after that day.

**Multiple murders**

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), if a Canadian offender who was subject to a sentence of imprisonment for life for a conviction for murder, or an offence that, if it had been committed in Canada, would have constituted murder, within the meaning of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), received an additional sentence of imprisonment for life — imposed by the foreign entity for a conviction for an offence that, if it had been committed in Canada, would have constituted murder within the meaning of that Act — the full parole ineligibility period in respect of the additional sentence is established under section 745 of that Act.

**Exception — second degree murder**

- **(3)** If the additional sentence referred to in subsection (2) is in respect of a conviction for an offence that, if it had been committed in Canada, would have constituted second degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) — and if the offence was committed before all of the Canadian offender’s convictions for murder, or for offences that, if they had been committed in Canada, would have constituted murder, within the meaning of that Act — the full parole ineligibility period in respect of the additional sentence is 10 years.

**Credit for time spent in custody**

- **(4)** In calculating the period of imprisonment for the purpose of this section, the time served by an offender includes any time spent in custody between the day on which they were arrested and taken into custody for the offence for which they were sentenced and the day on which the sentence was imposed.
> 2004, c. 21, s. 24; 2011, c. 2, s. 6.





**Temporary absence and day parole — persons convicted of murder**

**25** Subject to section 746.1 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md),
- **(a)** a Canadian offender who is transferred to Canada — and was sentenced to imprisonment for life for an offence that, if it had been committed in Canada, would have constituted murder within the meaning of that Act — is eligible for day parole in accordance with the [Corrections and Conditional Release Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2020.md) and for an absence without escort in accordance with the [Corrections and Conditional Release Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2020.md) or the [Prisons and Reformatories Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-20.md); and
- **(b)** their absence with escort may be authorized in accordance with the [Corrections and Conditional Release Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2020.md) or the [Prisons and Reformatories Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-20.md).




**Statutory release — penitentiary**

**26** 

- **(1)** If a Canadian offender is detained in a penitentiary, they are entitled to be released on statutory release on the day on which they have served, commencing on the day of their transfer, two thirds of the period determined in accordance with subsection 22(2).

**Release — prison**

- **(2)** If a Canadian offender is detained in a prison, they are entitled to be released on the day on which they have served, commencing on the day of their transfer, the period determined in accordance with subsection 22(2) less the amount of any remission earned under the [Prisons and Reformatories Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-20.md) on that period.




**If eligible for parole, etc., before transfer**

**27** If, under the [Corrections and Conditional Release Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2020.md) or the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), the day on which a Canadian offender is eligible for a temporary absence, day parole or full parole is before the day of their transfer, the day of their transfer is deemed to be their day of eligibility.




**Review by Board**

**28** Despite sections 122 and 123 of the [Corrections and Conditional Release Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2020.md), the Parole Board of Canada is not required to review the case of a Canadian offender until six months after the day of their transfer.
> 2004, c. 21, s. 28; 2012, c. 1, s. 160.

**31** If no treaty is in force between Canada and a foreign entity on the transfer of offenders, the Minister of Foreign Affairs may, with the consent of the Minister, enter into an administrative arrangement with the foreign entity for the transfer of an offender in accordance with this Act.




**Administrative arrangements — mentally disordered persons**

**32** 

- **(1)** If the relevant provincial authority consents to the transfer, the Minister of Foreign Affairs may, with the consent of the Minister, enter into an administrative arrangement with a foreign entity for the transfer, in accordance with this Act, of a person in respect of whom a verdict of unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder was rendered and may no longer be appealed.

**Consent — provincial authority**

- **(2)** The consent of a provincial authority to a transfer under this section shall take into account the purpose and principles of this Act. Consent to the transfer of a person in respect of whom a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has been rendered — or of a citizen or national of a foreign entity in respect of whom a verdict of unfit to stand trial has been rendered — is given by the attorney general of a province or, in the case of a territory, the Attorney General of Canada, on the recommendation of the relevant Review Board established under section 672.38 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md). Consent to the transfer of a Canadian citizen in respect of whom a verdict of unfit to stand trial has been rendered in a foreign entity is given by the relevant provincial authority.

**Factors — provincial authority**

- **(3)** A Review Board, in deciding whether to recommend to the attorney general that a person be transferred — and the relevant provincial authority, in deciding whether to consent to a transfer under subsection (2) — shall consider the following factors:
	- **(a)** the best interests of the person, including their mental condition, the likelihood of their reintegration into society and their treatment and other needs; and
	- **(b)** the need to protect society from dangerous persons.

**Additional factor — unfit to stand trial**

- **(4)** The attorney general, in deciding whether to consent to the transfer to a foreign entity of a person in respect of whom a verdict of unfit to stand trial has been rendered, shall consider their ability to effectively prosecute the case in the event that the person becomes fit to stand trial.




**Definition of foreign entity**

**33** In sections 31 and 32, ***foreign entity*** means a foreign state, a province, state or other political subdivision of a foreign state, a colony, dependency, possession, protectorate, condominium, trust territory or any territory falling under the jurisdiction of a foreign state or a territory or other entity, including an international criminal tribunal.

The verdict of the foreign court is deemed to be a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and to have been made on the day of their transfer.

The Review Board shall, within 45 days after the day of the person’s transfer, hold a hearing and make a disposition.

**Extension of time period**

- **(3)** If the Review Board is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant it, it may take a maximum of 90 days to hold a hearing and make a disposition.




**Transportation for transfer**

**35** 

- **(1)** A person who is discharged under paragraph 672.54(b) of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) or detained under paragraph 672.54(c) of that Act may — with the consent of the attorney general of the province from which they are to be transported and, if applicable, the attorney general of the province to which they are to be transported — be transported to any other place in Canada in order to expedite their transfer to a foreign entity.

**Warrant**

- **(2)** If a person is to be transported in order to expedite their transfer, an officer authorized by the attorney general of the province from which they are to be transported shall sign a warrant specifying the place in Canada to which they are to be transported, the terms of their transfer and, if applicable, the place of detention.

**Territories**

- **(3)** For the purpose of this section, in respect of a territory, the relevant attorney general is the Attorney General of Canada.




**Transportation and detention**

**36** A warrant referred to in subsection 35(2) is sufficient authority for
- **(a)** the person who is responsible for the custody and transportation of the person being transferred to convey them to the place in Canada to which they are to be transported and, if applicable, deliver them to the person in charge of the place of detention;
- **(b)** the person in charge of the place of detention to detain the person being transferred; and
