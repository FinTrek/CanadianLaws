**Preamble**

  WHEREAS it is deemed appropriate that an international bridge providing facilities for the carriage of highway traffic between Canada and the United States be operated on a joint international basis by a public authority having equal representation of members appointed from each of the two countries, and having power to levy tolls to meet the costs of operating and maintaining such a bridge;

  AND whereas there is at present no competent authority to levy tolls to defray the costs of operating and maintaining the Canadian portion of the international bridge connecting Canada and the United States across the St. Clair River, commonly known as the Blue Water Bridge, and it is deemed advisable that, pending the establishment of a competent joint international authority to operate the Blue Water Bridge, an authority be established at the earliest possible date to operate and maintain the Canadian portion of the said bridge and to levy tolls to defray the costs thereof;



  NOW, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
