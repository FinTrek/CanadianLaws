- **2.** The Board shall gazette a notice in form D, describing the land by metes and bounds or otherwise, and stating that it has been compulsorily purchased by the Board and the amount of compensation money that the Board is willing to pay, whereupon the land as described shall by such gazetting and by force of this Act become and remain vested in the Board as for an estate of fee simple in possession or, in the province of Quebec, in the Board as absolute owner, and in any event freed and discharged from all other estates and from all encumbrances, liens, claims and interests whatever, and as effectually as if it had been conveyed by deed or conveyance of all persons entitled to any interest therein, but compensation, ascertained as in this Part provided, shall be paid therefor.

**Gazetting a tender of compensation**

- **3.** The amount of compensation money mentioned in such notice gazetted shall be deemed to have been by such gazetting and by force of this Act, tendered to the persons entitled to any interest in said land, collectively.

**Gazetting proof of conditions complied with**

- **4.** The gazetting of the notice in form D shall for all purposes be conclusive proof that all necessary steps and conditions precedent thereto have been duly taken and complied with.

**Re-gazetting to correct error in gazetted notice**

**When owner claims compensation inadequate Board may lay information before Federal Court**

- **6.** If within sixty days from the date of such gazetting the owner being in the province or in any place in North America, or within one hundred days the owner being elsewhere, no proper deed or conveyance to the Board is made and executed by the person or persons having power to make and execute such deed or conveyance, or if the owner or any person interested in the land, by notice served on the Board before the expiration of the stated period, claims that the compensation tendered by such gazetting is inadequate, the Board may cause to be exhibited in the Court an information in which shall be set forth
	- **(a)** the date at which and the manner in which such land was acquired or taken;

- **9.** Any person who is mentioned in any such information, or who afterwards is made or becomes a party thereto, may, by his answer, exception or defence, raise any question of fact or law incident to the determination of his right to such compensation money or any part thereof, or in respect of the sufficiency of such compensation money.

**Such proceedings bar all claims to compensation, etc.**

- **10.** Such proceedings shall, so far as the parties thereto are concerned, bar all claims to the compensation money or any part thereof, including any claim of dower, or of dower not yet open, as well as in respect of all mortgages, hypothecs or encumbrances upon the land or property; and the Court shall make such order for the distribution, payment or investment of the compensation money and for the securing of the rights of all persons interested, as to right and justice, according to the provisions of this Act and to law appertain.
