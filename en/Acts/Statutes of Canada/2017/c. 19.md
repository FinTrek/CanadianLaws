**S.C. 2017, c. 19**


Assented to on 22 June 2017

----------




**Preamble**

Whereas Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia are progressive, degenerative diseases of the brain that result in impairment of thought processes and memory, as well as changes in abilities and behaviour;

Whereas Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia erode an individual’s independence and eventually cause death;

Whereas there are more than 747,000 Canadians living with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia;

Whereas, as Canada’s population ages, the number of Canadians diagnosed with these diseases is expected to double within a generation;

Whereas research, collaboration and partnerships remain the key to finding a cure, and early diagnosis and support for treatment can lead to positive health outcomes for people with any form of dementia and can have a positive impact on the family and friends who provide care for them;

And whereas the Government of Canada, in consultation with the ministers responsible for the delivery of health services in each province and territory should encourage the development of a national strategy for the care of people living with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia, as well as their families and caregivers;
