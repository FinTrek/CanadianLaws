**Preamble**

Whereas sickle cell disease is characterized by a mutation in the shape of the red blood cell from a smooth, circular shape to a crescent shape, which can result in the blockage of small blood vessels and the impairment of blood flow, leading to a reduction in red blood cell survival and subsequent anemia;

Whereas the poor blood oxygen levels and blood vessel blockages that result from sickle cell disease can lead to severe chronic pain, serious bacterial infections and tissue death;

Whereas blood vessel blockages can affect all parts of the body and result in organs becoming starved for oxygen and unable to function properly;

Whereas the lifespan of persons with severe sickle cell disease can be reduced by as much as 30 years;

Whereas approximately 5% of the world’s population carries the trait gene for sickle cell disease, with the percentage of carriers of the gene being as high as 25% in some regions;

Whereas sickle cell disease is particularly common among people whose ancestors come from India, Saudi Arabia and Mediterranean and Sub-Saharan African countries;

Whereas it is important to raise awareness of sickle cell disease, including the need for uniform screening of newborns and improved diagnosis and treatment of the disease;

And whereas the 19th of June is recognized annually by organizations such as the African Union, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, as World Sickle Cell Day in order to promote awareness of the disease around the world;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






## Short Title



**Short title**
