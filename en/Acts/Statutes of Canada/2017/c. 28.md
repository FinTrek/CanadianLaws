----------




**Preamble**

Whereas the Final Report of the External Panel on Options for a Legislative Response to *Carter v. Canada* emphasizes the importance of palliative care in the context of physician-assisted dying;

Whereas the Final Report stated that a request for physician-assisted death cannot be truly voluntary if the option of proper palliative care is not available to alleviate a person’s suffering;

And whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes the importance of ensuring that all Canadians have access to high-quality palliative care, especially in the context of physician-assisted death;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
