Whereas, on September 1, 1864, leaders of the governments and legislatures of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of Canada met in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and created a shared vision of a union of the British North American colonies and the creation of a new country;

Whereas the ambitions and ideals that flourished at and grew out of the Charlottetown Conference form part of the basis for the nation of Canada;

Whereas the rich heritage of Charlottetown is reflected in the recognition of Province House, where the discussions took place, as a national historic site and in the recognition of other national historic sites in Charlottetown in view of their strong association with the birth of this country;

Whereas, by Proclamation of the Prime Minister of Canada on September 1, 1996, the role of Charlottetown as the birthplace of Confederation was recognized and affirmed as an integral part of our Canadian heritage;

And whereas September 1, 2014, marked the 150th anniversary of the Charlottetown Conference, which, along with the Quebec Conference of 1864 and the London Conference of 1866-1867, led to the promulgation of the Constitution Act, 1867;
