----------




**Preamble**

Whereas there is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change;

Whereas recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are at the highest level in history and present an unprecedented risk to the environment, including its biological diversity, to human health and safety and to economic prosperity;

Whereas impacts of climate change, such as coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security are already being felt throughout Canada and are impacting Canadians, in particular the Indigenous peoples of Canada, low-income citizens and northern, coastal and remote communities;

Whereas Parliament recognizes that it is the responsibility of the present generation to minimize impacts of climate change on future generations;

Whereas the United Nations, Parliament and the scientific community have identified climate change as an international concern which cannot be contained within geographic boundaries;

Whereas Canada has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, done in New York on May 9, 1992, which entered into force in 1994, and the objective of that Convention is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system;

Whereas Canada has also ratified the Paris Agreement, done in Paris on December 12, 2015, which entered into force in 2016, and the aims of that Agreement include holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to achieving Canada’s Nationally Determined Contribution – and increasing it over time – under the Paris Agreement by taking comprehensive action to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy, accelerate clean economic growth and build resilience to the impacts of climate change;

Whereas it is recognized in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change that climate change is a national problem that requires immediate action by all governments in Canada as well as by industry, non-governmental organizations and individual Canadians;

Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing is a core element of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change;

Whereas behavioural change that leads to increased energy efficiency, to the use of cleaner energy, to the adoption of cleaner technologies and practices and to innovation is necessary for effective action against climate change;

Whereas the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions on a basis that increases over time is an appropriate and efficient way to create incentives for that behavioural change;

Whereas greenhouse gas emissions pricing reflects the “polluter pays” principle;

Whereas some provinces are developing or have implemented greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems;

Whereas the absence of greenhouse gas emissions pricing in some provinces and a lack of stringency in some provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems could contribute to significant deleterious effects on the environment, including its biological diversity, on human health and safety and on economic prosperity;

And whereas it is necessary to create a federal greenhouse gas emissions pricing scheme to ensure that, taking provincial greenhouse gas emissions pricing systems into account, greenhouse gas emissions pricing applies broadly in Canada;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






## Short Title

in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(b), and the charge, lien, priority or binding interest created is subordinate to any charge, lien, priority or binding interest in respect of which all steps necessary to make it effective against other creditors were taken before the time the memorial was filed, registered or otherwise recorded.

	- **(a)** a memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording under subsection (4), or a document relating to the memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording for the purpose of any proceeding described in subsection (6), to any official in the land registry system, personal property or movable property registry system, or other registry system, of a province, or
	- **(b)** access is sought to any person, place or thing in a province to make the filing, registration or other recording,
the memorial or document must be accepted for filing, registration or other recording or the access must be granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial or document relating to the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(b) for the purpose of a like proceeding, except that, if the memorial or document is issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence required under the law of the province to be provided with or to accompany the memorial or document in the proceedings is deemed to have been provided with or to have accompanied the memorial or document as so required.

However, if that consent is subsequently given, any property that would have been affected by that process, charge, lien, priority or binding interest if the Minister’s consent had been given at the time that process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding interest was created, as the case may be, is bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise affected as it would be if that consent had been given at the time that process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding interest was created, as the case may be.

**Completion of notices, etc.**

- **(9)** If information required to be set out by any sheriff or other person in a minute, notice or document required to be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsection (8), be so set out without the written consent of the Minister, the sheriff or other person must complete the minute, notice or document to the extent possible without that information and, when that consent of the Minister is given, a further minute, notice or document setting out all the information must be completed for the same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having complied with this subsection, is deemed to have complied with this Part, regulation or rule requiring the information to be set out in the minute, notice or document.

	- **(a)** to be a claim that is secured by a security and that, subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a secured claim under that Act; and
	- **(b)** to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)(a) of that Act.

**Details in certificates and memorials**

#### Sentencing



**Fundamental purpose**

**247** The fundamental purpose of sentencing for offences under this Part is to contribute — in light of the risks posed by climate change to the environment, including its biological diversity, to human health and safety and to economic prosperity — to respect for laws related to the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions through the imposition of just sanctions that have as their objectives
- **(a)** the deterrence of the offender and any other person from committing offences under this Part;
- **(b)** the denunciation of the unlawful conduct; and
- **(c)** the reinforcement of the “polluter pays” principle.




**Principles**

**248** 

- **(1)** In addition to the principles and factors that the court is otherwise required to consider, including those set out in sections 718.1 to 718.21 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), the court must consider the following principles when sentencing a person that is convicted of an offence under this Part:
	- **(a)** the amount of the fine should be increased to account for every aggravating factor associated with the offence, including the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2); and
	- **(b)** the amount of the fine should reflect the gravity of each aggravating factor associated with the offence.

**Aggravating factors**

- **(2)** The aggravating factors are the following:
	- **(a)** the offender committed the offence intentionally or recklessly;
	- **(b)** the offender failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence despite having the financial means to do so;
	- **(c)** by committing the offence or failing to take action to prevent its commission, the offender increased revenue or decreased costs or intended to increase revenue or decrease costs;
	- **(d)** the offender committed the offence despite having been warned by an enforcement officer of the circumstances that subsequently became the subject of the offence;
	- **(e)** the offender has a history of non-compliance with federal or provincial legislation that relates to the control or pricing of greenhouse gas emissions; and
	- **(f)** after the commission of the offence, the offender
		- **(i)** attempted to conceal its commission,
		- **(ii)** failed to take prompt action to prevent, mitigate or remediate its effects, or
		- **(iii)** failed to take prompt action to reduce the risk of committing similar offences in the future.

**Absence of aggravating factor**

- **(3)** The absence of an aggravating factor set out in subsection (2) is not a mitigating factor.

**Reasons**

- **(4)** If the court is satisfied of the existence of one or more of the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2) but decides not to increase the amount of the fine because of that factor, the court must give reasons for that decision.




**Orders of court**

**249** 

- **(1)** If an offender has been convicted of an offence under this Part, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed under this Part, the court may, having regard to the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, make an order having any or all of the following effects:
	- **(a)** prohibiting the offender from doing any act or engaging in any activity that may result in the continuation or repetition of the offence;
	- **(b)** directing the offender to implement a greenhouse gas emissions control or reduction system that meets a recognized Canadian or international standard;

	- **(i)** directing the offender to compensate any person, monetarily or otherwise, in whole or in part, for the cost of any remedial or preventive action taken, caused to be taken or to be taken as a result of the act or omission that constituted the offence, including costs of assessing appropriate remedial or preventive action;

**Debt due to Her Majesty**

- **(3)** If the court makes an order under paragraph (1)(d) or (i) directing an offender to pay an amount to Her Majesty in right of Canada, or if the Minister incurs publication costs under subsection (2), the amount or the costs, as the case may be, constitute a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Enforcement**

- **(4)** If the court makes an order under subsection (1) directing an offender to pay an amount to a person other than to Her Majesty in right of Canada and the amount is not paid without delay, the person may, by filing the order, enter as a judgment, in the superior court of the province in which the trial was held, the amount ordered to be paid, and that judgment is enforceable against the offender in the same manner as if it were a judgment rendered against the offender in that court in civil proceedings.

**Imposition of sentence**

- **(2)** If the person does not comply with the order or is convicted of another offence within three years after the order is made, the court may, on the application of the prosecution, impose any sentence that could have been imposed if the passing of sentence had not been suspended.




**Application of fines**

**251** 

- **(1)** Subject to regulations made under section 241, all fines received by the Receiver General in respect of the commission of an offence under this Part or any amount received in accordance with an order under paragraph 249(1)(d) are to be credited to the Environmental Damages Fund, an account in the accounts of Canada, and used for purposes related to protecting, conserving or restoring the environment or for administering that Fund.
