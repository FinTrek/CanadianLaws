# Postal Services Resumption and Continuation Act

**S.C. 2018, c. 25**


Assented to on 26 November 2018

----------




**Preamble**

Whereas the Canada Post Corporation and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers were parties to two collective agreements, one that expired on December 31, 2017 and one that expired on January 31, 2018;

Whereas the parties have engaged, since November 2017, in collective bargaining to reach new collective agreements;

Whereas the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services met with the parties on a number of occasions to encourage them to reach new collective agreements;

Whereas the Minister of Labour appointed conciliation officers in July 2018 to assist the parties in their negotiations and the conciliation period expired without the parties having entered into new collective agreements;

Whereas the Minister of Labour appointed mediators in September 2018 to further assist the parties in the negotiation of a settlement of their differences for the purpose of renewing their collective agreements;

Whereas work stoppages commenced on October 22, 2018;

Whereas the Minister of Labour appointed a special mediator on October 24, 2018, and then re-appointed the special mediator on November 7, 2018, to assist the parties in negotiating new collective agreements and in ending the work stoppages, and in each case the appointment ended without the parties having entered into new collective agreements and without the work stoppages having ended;

Whereas the work stoppages are disrupting the delivery of mail and parcels across Canada;

Whereas the work stoppages are having a significant adverse impact on Canadian workers, consumers and businesses as well as on those Canadians who rely on postal services;

Whereas the Minister of Labour recognizes the importance of effective collective bargaining practices and the need for stable industrial relations for employees, unions and employers in the postal services sector;

And whereas, having regard to the negative impact of the work stoppages, the public interest requires an exceptional solution to address the matters in dispute so that new collective agreements may be concluded;



Now therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

**Extension**

**6** 

- **(1)** The term of the collective agreement that expired on December 31, 2017 is extended to include the period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending immediately before a new collective agreement between the parties comes into effect, except for any period during which there is

**Appointment of mediator-arbitrator**

- **(2)** If the two lists have only one name in common, the Minister must appoint that individual as the mediator-arbitrator, and if they have more than one name in common, he or she must appoint one of those individuals. However, if the Minister does not receive both lists within the period referred to in subsection (1), or if the lists that are received within that period have no names in common, he or she must appoint the mediator-arbitrator after seeking advice from the Chairperson of the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

**Duties of mediator-arbitrator**

		- **(i)** hear the parties on the matter, arbitrate the matter and render a decision in respect of the matter, or
		- **(ii)** ask each of the parties to submit, within the time and in the manner that he or she may specify, that party’s final offer in respect of the matter and, subject to subsection (7), select, in order to resolve the matter, either the final offer of the employer or the final offer of the union; and
	- **(c)** report to the Minister on the resolution of each of the matters that were referred to the mediator-arbitrator and provide the parties with a copy of the report.

**Guiding principles**

- **(3)** In rendering a decision or selecting a final offer under paragraph (1)(b), the mediator-arbitrator is to be guided by the need

**Contractual language — decision**

- **(5)** Every decision of the mediator-arbitrator under subparagraph (1)(b)(i) must be worded in appropriate contractual language so as to allow its incorporation into a new collective agreement.

**New collective agreements not precluded**

**12** Nothing in this Act precludes the parties to a collective agreement from entering into a new collective agreement at any time before the mediator-arbitrator reports to the Minister under paragraph 11(1)(c) and, if they do so, the mediator-arbitrator’s duties under this Act respecting the collective agreement cease as of the day on which the new collective agreement is entered into.




**Costs**

**13** All costs incurred by Her Majesty in right of Canada relating to the appointment of the mediator-arbitrator and the performance of their duties under this Act are debts due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered as such, in equal parts from the employer and the union, in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**New collective agreement**

**14** 

- **(1)** Despite anything in Part I of the [Canada Labour Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/L/L-2.md), but subject to subsection (2), beginning on the day after the day on which the mediator-arbitrator reports to the Minister under paragraph 11(1)(c) in respect of the matters that were referred to them in respect of the amendment or revision of a collective agreement (in this subsection referred to as the “former collective agreement”), a new collective agreement consisting of the following is effective and binding on the parties:
	- **(a)** every agreement entered into by the parties, before the appointment of the mediator-arbitrator, in relation to the amendment or revision of the former collective agreement;
	- **(b)** every agreement entered into by the parties, after the appointment of the mediator-arbitrator, in relation to the matters that were referred to the mediator-arbitrator relating to the amendment or revision of the former collective agreement; and

**Application**

- **(2)** Part I of the [Canada Labour Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/L/L-2.md) applies in respect of the new collective agreement as if it had been entered into under that Part.

**Coming into effect of provisions**

- **(3)** The new collective agreement may provide that any of its provisions are effective and binding as of a day that is before or after the day on which the new collective agreement becomes effective and binding.

**Amendments**

- **(4)** Nothing in this Act is to be construed so as to limit or restrict the rights of the parties to the new collective agreement to amend any of its provisions and to give effect to the amendment.
