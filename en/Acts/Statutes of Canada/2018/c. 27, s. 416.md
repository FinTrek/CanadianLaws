**Notice of establishment of plan without committee**

**25** If an employer, despite having made all reasonable efforts, is unable to establish a pay equity committee, the employer must apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner for authorization to establish the pay equity plan without a pay equity committee. If that authorization is granted, the employer must post a notice informing the employees to whom the pay equity plan relates that the employer will establish the pay equity plan without a pay equity committee.




**Notice of establishment of plan without committee — group of employers**

**26** If a group of employers, despite having made all reasonable efforts, is unable to establish a pay equity committee, the group must apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner for authorization to establish the pay equity plan without a committee. If that authorization is granted, each employer in the group must post a notice informing its employees to whom the pay equity plan relates that the group of employers will establish the pay equity plan without a committee.




**Committee does not meet requirement after establishment**

**27** If a pay equity committee established by an employer does not, at any time after it has been established, meet the requirements set out in any of paragraphs 19(1)(a), (b), (d) and (e), the employer must apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner for authorization for the continuation of the committee with different requirements than the ones set out in that paragraph.




**Committee cannot perform work**

**28** If, at any time after establishing a pay equity committee, an employer is of the opinion that the committee is unable to perform its work, the employer may apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner for authorization to establish the pay equity plan without a committee. If that authorization is granted, the employer must post a notice informing the employees to whom the pay equity plan relates that the employer will establish the pay equity plan without a committee.




**Committee cannot perform work — group of employers**

**29** If, at any time after establishing a pay equity committee, a group of employers is of the opinion that the committee is unable to perform its work, the group may apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner for authorization to establish the pay equity plan without a committee. If that authorization is granted, each employer in the group must post a notice informing its employees to whom the pay equity plan relates that the group of employers will establish the pay equity plan without a committee.




**Multiple plans**

**30** 

- **(1)** An employer referred to in subsection 16(1) or (3), a bargaining agent for any unionized employees of the employer or a non-unionized employee of the employer may apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner to approve the establishment of more than one pay equity plan.

**Multiple plans — group of employers**

- **(2)** A group of employers referred to in subsection 17(1) or (3), a bargaining agent for any unionized employees of an employer that is in the group or a non-unionized employee of an employer that is in the group may apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner to approve the establishment of more than one pay equity plan.

**Application — required information**

- **(3)** The employer, group of employers, bargaining agent or employee, as the case may be, must, in the application,
	- **(a)** indicate the number of pay equity plans being proposed; and
	- **(b)** identify the employer’s employees — or, if the employer is in a group of employers, all of the employees of the employers in the group — to whom each pay equity plan would relate.

**Evidence and representations**

- **(4)** The Pay Equity Commissioner must give an opportunity to make representations, in the manner that he or she specifies, to the applicant, to the employer or group of employers, if it is not the applicant, and to any bargaining agents and non-unionized employees that are not the applicant and that the Pay Equity Commissioner considers would be affected by the application.

**Denial of application**

- **(5)** The Pay Equity Commissioner must deny the application if he or she is of the opinion that, if more than one pay equity plan were to be established it would not be possible for the employer or group of employers, or a pay equity committee, as the case may be, to identify enough predominantly male job classes for a comparison of compensation to be made under section 47 in respect of each of those pay equity plans.

**Approval of application**

- **(6)** If the Pay Equity Commissioner approves the application, the employer or group of employers, as the case may be, must establish, in accordance with this Act, each of the pay equity plans whose establishment is approved.




**PART 2** 
## Process for Establishment of Pay Equity Plan



### Purpose



**Steps to be followed**

**31** The purpose of this Part is to set out the steps leading to the establishment of a pay equity plan.




### Identification of Job Classes



**Job classes**

**32** An employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — must start by identifying the job class of positions occupied or that may be occupied by employees to whom the pay equity plan relates. Subject to section 34, positions are considered to be in the same job class if
- **(a)** they have similar duties and responsibilities;
- **(b)** they require similar qualifications; and
- **(c)** they are part of the same compensation plan and are within the same range of salary rates.




**One-position job classes**

**33** A job class may consist of only one position.




**Job classes in core public administration**

**34** Positions in the core public administration that are at the same group and level comprise a single job class.




### Determination of Predominantly Female and Predominantly Male Job Classes



**Determination**

**35** Once an employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — has identified all of the job classes under section 32, it must determine which of them are predominantly female job classes and which of them are predominantly male job classes.




**Predominantly female job classes**

**36** A job class is considered to be a predominantly female job class if
- **(a)** at least 60% of the positions in the job class are occupied by women;
- **(b)** historically, at least 60% of the positions in the job class were occupied by women; or
- **(c)** the job class is one that is commonly associated with women due to gender-based occupational stereotyping.




**Predominantly male job classes**

**37** A job class is considered to be a predominantly male job class if
- **(a)** at least 60% of the positions in the job class are occupied by men;
- **(b)** historically, at least 60% of the positions in the job class were occupied by men; or
- **(c)** the job class is one that is commonly associated with men due to gender-based occupational stereotyping.




**Group of job classes**

**38** 

- **(1)** An employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — may treat a group of job classes as a single predominantly female job class if at least 60% of the positions in the group are occupied by women.

**Interpretation**

- **(2)** If an employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, treats a group of job classes as a single predominantly female job class, this Act applies in respect of the group of job classes as if it were a single predominantly female job class, unless the context otherwise requires.




**Notice to Pay Equity Commissioner**

**39** If an employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — determines under section 35 that there is at least one predominantly female job class but that there are no predominantly male job classes, and no regulations have been made under paragraph 181(1)(c), the employer must notify the Pay Equity Commissioner of that determination.




**Application of regulations**

**40** If regulations have been made under paragraph 181(1)(c), those regulations apply in place of sections 41 to 50.




### Determination of Value of Work



**Determination**

**41** 

- **(1)** If an employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — determines under section 35 that there is at least one predominantly female job class and at least one predominantly male job class, the employer or committee, as the case may be, must determine the value of the work performed in each of the predominantly female and predominantly male job classes determined under that section.

**Value already determined**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, an employer referred to in any of paragraphs 3(2)(a) to (d) or a pay equity committee established by such an employer, as the case may be, may determine that the value of the work performed in each of the predominantly female and predominantly male job classes determined under section 35 is the value that has already been determined by means of a method that complies with the requirements set out in sections 42 and 43 and any other requirements that are prescribed by regulation.

**Group of job classes**

- **(3)** If an employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, treats a group of job classes as a predominantly female job class in accordance with section 38, the value of the work performed in that job class is considered to be the value of the work performed in the individual predominantly female job class within the group that has the greatest number of employees.




**Criterion**

**42** The criterion to be applied in determining the value of the work performed is the composite of the skill required to perform the work, the effort required to perform the work, the responsibility required in the performance of the work and the conditions under which the work is performed.




**Method**

**43** In addition, an employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — must, to determine the value of the work performed, use a method that
- **(a)** does not discriminate on the basis of gender; and
- **(b)** makes it possible to determine the relative value of the work performed in all of the predominantly female and predominantly male job classes determined under section 35.




### Calculation of Compensation



**Calculation**

**44** 

- **(1)** An employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — must calculate the compensation, expressed in dollars per hour, associated with each job class for which it has determined, under section 41, the value of the work performed.

**Group of job classes**

- **(2)** If an employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, treats a group of job classes as a predominantly female job class in accordance with section 38, the compensation associated with that job class is considered to be the compensation associated with the individual predominantly female job class within the group that has the greatest number of employees.

**Salary**

- **(3)** For the purpose of determining salary in the calculation of the compensation associated with a job class, the salary at the highest rate in the range of salary rates for positions in the job class is to be used.




**Exclusions from compensation**

**45** An employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — may exclude from the calculation of compensation, with respect to each job class in respect of which compensation is required to be calculated, any form of compensation that is equally available, and provided without discrimination on the basis of gender, in respect of all of those job classes.




**Differences in compensation excluded**

**46** An employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — must exclude from the calculation of compensation associated with a job class any differences in compensation that either increase or decrease compensation in any or all positions in that job class as compared with the compensation that would otherwise be associated with the position, if the differences are based on any one or more of the following factors and those factors have been designed and are applied so as not to discriminate on the basis of gender:
- **(a)** the existence of a system of compensation that is based on seniority or length of service;
- **(b)** the practice of temporarily maintaining an employee’s compensation following their reclassification or demotion to a position that has a lower rate of compensation until the rate of compensation for the position is equivalent to or greater than the rate of compensation payable to the employee immediately before the reclassification or demotion;
- **(c)** a shortage of skilled workers that causes an employer to temporarily increase compensation due to its difficulty in recruiting or retaining employees with the requisite skills for positions in a job class;
- **(d)** the geographic area in which an employee works;
- **(e)** the fact that an employee is in an employee development or training program and receives compensation at a rate different than that of an employee doing the same work in a position outside the program;
- **(f)** the non-receipt of compensation — in the form of benefits that have a monetary value — due to the temporary, casual or seasonal nature of a position;
- **(g)** the existence of a merit-based compensation plan that is based on a system of formal performance ratings and that has been brought to the attention of the employees; or
- **(h)** the provision of compensation for extra-duty services, including compensation for overtime, shift work, being on call, being called back to work and working or travelling on a day that is not a working day.




### Comparison of Compensation



**Comparison**

**47** An employer — or, if a pay equity committee has been established, that committee — that has calculated under section 44 the compensation associated with each job class must, using the compensation so calculated, compare, in accordance with sections 48 to 50, the compensation associated with the predominantly female job classes with the compensation associated with the predominantly male job classes, for the purpose of determining whether there is any difference in compensation between those job classes.




**Compensation comparison methods**

**48** 

- **(1)** The comparison of compensation must be made in accordance with the equal average method set out in section 49 or the equal line method set out in section 50.

**Other methods**

- **(2)** Despite subsection (1),
	- **(a)** if an employer determines that neither of the methods referred to in that subsection can be used, the employer must
		- **(i)** apply to the Pay Equity Commissioner for authorization to use a method for the comparison of compensation that is prescribed by regulation or, if the regulations do not prescribe a method or the employer is of the opinion that the prescribed method cannot be used, a method that it proposes, and
		- **(ii)** use the method for the comparison of compensation that the Pay Equity Commissioner authorizes; and
	- **(b)** if a pay equity committee determines that neither of the methods referred to in that subsection can be used, the committee must use a method for the comparison of compensation that is prescribed by regulation or, if the regulations do not prescribe a method or the committee is of the opinion that the prescribed method cannot be used, a method that it considers appropriate.




**Equal average method**

**49** 

- **(1)** An employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, that uses the equal average method of comparison of compensation must apply the following rules:
	- **(a)** the average compensation associated with the predominantly female job classes within a band — or, if there is only one such job class within a band, the compensation associated with that job class — is to be compared to
		- **(i)** if there is more than one predominantly male job class within the band, the average compensation associated with the predominantly male job classes within the band,
		- **(ii)** if there is only one predominantly male job class within the band, the compensation associated with that job class, or
		- **(iii)** if there are no predominantly male job classes within the band, the compensation calculated under paragraph (b);
	- **(b)** the compensation for the purpose of subparagraph (a)(iii) is the following:
		- **(i)** the amount determined by the formula
```
(A × B)/C
```
where
- **A** is the average compensation associated with the predominantly male job classes — or if there is only one such job class, the compensation associated with that job class — that are within the band that is closest to the band within which the predominantly female job class or classes are located,
- **B** is the average value of the work performed in the predominantly female job classes within the band or, if there is only one such job class, the value of the work performed in that job class, and
- **C** is the average value of the work performed in the predominantly male job classes within the band referred to in the description of A or, if there is only one such job class, the value of the work performed in that job class, or
		- **(ii)** despite subparagraph (i), if there is at least one predominantly male job class within each of two bands that are equidistant from the band within which the predominantly female job class or classes are located, and there is no other band containing at least one predominantly male job class that is closer to that band, the amount determined by the formula
```
(A + B)/2
```
where
- **A** is the average compensation associated with the predominantly male job classes within one of the two bands or, if there is only one such job class, the compensation associated with that job class, and
- **B** is the average compensation associated with the predominantly male job classes within the other band or, if there is only one such job class, the compensation associated with that job class;
	- **(c)** the compensation associated with a predominantly female job class within a band is to be increased only if
		- **(i)** that compensation is lower than the compensation or average compensation referred to subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii), as the case may be, and
		- **(ii)** the average compensation associated with the predominantly female job classes within the band — or, if there is only one such job class, the compensation associated with that job class — is lower than the compensation or average compensation referred to subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii), as the case may be;
	- **(d)** if the compensation associated with a predominantly female job class within a band is to be increased, the increase is to be determined by multiplying the factor calculated in accordance with the regulations by an amount equal to the difference between the compensation associated with the job class and the compensation or average compensation referred to subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii), as the case may be; and
	- **(e)** an increase in compensation associated with the predominantly female job class or classes within a band is to be made in such a way that, after the increase, the average compensation associated with the predominantly female job classes within the band — or, if there is only one such job class, the compensation associated with that job class — is equal to the compensation or average compensation referred to subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii), as the case may be.

**Definition of band**

- **(2)** In this section, ***band*** means a range, as determined by an employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, of values of work that the employer or committee considers comparable.




**Equal line method**

**50** 

- **(1)** An employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, that uses the equal line method of comparison of compensation must apply the following rules:
	- **(a)** a female regression line must be established for the predominantly female job classes and a male regression line must be established for the predominantly male job classes;
	- **(b)** the compensation associated with a predominantly female job class is to be increased only if
		- **(i)** the female regression line is entirely below the male regression line, and
		- **(ii)** the predominantly female job class is located below the male regression line;
	- **(c)** if the compensation associated with a predominantly female job class is to be increased, the increase is to be determined by multiplying the factor calculated in accordance with the regulations by an amount equal to the difference between the compensation associated with the predominantly female job class and the compensation associated with a predominantly male job class, were such a job class located on the male regression line, in which the value of the work performed is equal to that of the predominantly female job class; and
	- **(d)** an increase in compensation associated with the predominantly female job classes is to be made in such a way that, after the increase, the female regression line coincides with the male regression line.

**Crossed regression lines**

- **(2)** Despite paragraphs (1)(b) to (d), if the female regression line crosses the male regression line, an employer or pay equity committee, as the case may be, must apply the rules for the comparison of compensation that are prescribed by regulation.




### Contents and Posting



**Contents of plan**

**51** A pay equity plan must
- **(a)** indicate the number of pay equity plans required to be established in respect of the employer’s employees or, if the employer is in a group of employers, in respect of the employees of the employers in the group;
- **(b)** indicate the number of employees that the employer — or, in the case of a group of employers, each employer in the group — was considered to have for the purpose of determining whether a pay equity committee was required to be established in respect of the pay equity plan;
- **(c)** indicate whether a pay equity committee has been established and, if so, whether it meets the requirements set out in subsection 19(1) or, if not, whether the employer or group of employers, as the case may be, obtained the authorization of the Pay Equity Commissioner to establish a pay equity committee with different requirements;

### Increases in Compensation



**Obligation to increase compensation**

**60** If a pay equity plan posted by an employer in accordance with section 55, subsection 57(2) or paragraph 94(1)(b), as the case may be, discloses differences in compensation between predominantly female job classes and predominantly male job classes or, if there are no predominantly male job classes, differences in compensation that are determined in accordance with regulations made under paragraph 181(1)(c), the employer must increase — in accordance with the provisions of the pay equity plan that meet the requirements set out in paragraph 51(k) — the compensation that is payable to its employees who occupy positions in the predominantly female job classes for which an increase in compensation is required to be made under that pay equity plan.




**Date payable — plan posted under section 55 or paragraph 94(1)(b)**

**61** 

- **(1)** In the case of an employer that posted a pay equity plan in accordance with section 55 or paragraph 94(1)(b), as the case may be, the increase in compensation required to be made under section 60 is payable,
	- **(a)** subject to paragraph (b),
		- **(i)** if the pay equity plan was posted in accordance with subsection 55(1), on the day after the third anniversary of the date on which the employer became subject to this Act, or
		- **(ii)** if the pay equity plan was posted in accordance with paragraph 94(1)(b), on the day after the day that is 18 months after the date on which the employer became subject to this Act; or
	- **(b)** in the case of an employer that is in a group of employers, on the day after the third anniversary of the date on which the group of employers became subject to this Act.

**Phase in of increase**

- **(2)** Despite subsection (1), if an employer posted a pay equity plan in accordance with section 55 or paragraph 94(1)(b), as the case may be — or posted, on the same day, more than one pay equity plan in accordance with that section or paragraph — and if the total amount, in dollars, of the increase in compensation required to be made by the employer under section 60 in respect of all employees to whom the pay equity plan or plans relate is, for the year in which the increase is required to be made under subsection (1), more than 1% of the employer’s payroll for the year that is immediately before that year, the employer may choose to phase in the increase in respect of that plan or those plans, in which case
	- **(a)** the employer must establish, in accordance with the following, a schedule of increases for the phase-in period:
		- **(i)** the increases

**Liability of parties to violation**

**130** If an employer or bargaining agent commits a violation, any of the following persons who directed, authorized, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in the commission of the violation is a party to the violation and is liable to a penalty of an amount to be determined in accordance with the regulations, whether or not the employer or bargaining agent has been proceeded against in accordance with this Part:

- **(b)** any senior official of the employer or bargaining agent; or
- **(c)** any other person authorized to exercise managerial or supervisory functions on behalf of the employer or bargaining agent.




**Employees or agents or mandataries**

**131** An employer or bargaining agent is liable for a violation that is committed by any of their employees or agents or mandataries acting in the course of their employment or the scope of their authority as agent or mandatary, whether or not the employee or agent or mandatary that actually committed the violation is identified.




**Notice of violation**

**132** 

- **(1)** If the Pay Equity Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that an employer, group of employers, bargaining agent or other person has committed a violation, he or she may issue a notice of violation and must cause it to be served on the employer, each employer in the group of employers, the bargaining agent or the other person.

**Contents**

### Rules About Violations



**Certain defences not available**

**133** 

- **(1)** An employer, group of employers, bargaining agent or other person named in a notice of violation does not have a defence by reason that the employer, group of employers, bargaining agent or other person

	- **(b)** reasonably and honestly believed in the existence of facts that, if true, would exonerate the employer, group of employers, bargaining agent or other person.

**Common law principles**

- **(2)** Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse if the act or omission to which the violation relates could have been the subject of a charge for an offence under this Act but for section 135 applies in respect of a violation to the extent that it is not inconsistent with this Act.




**Continuing violation**

**134** A violation that is committed or continued on more than one day constitutes a separate violation for each day on which it is committed or continued.

**135** For greater certainty, a violation is not an offence and, accordingly, section 126 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) does not apply in respect of a violation.




**Limitation period**
