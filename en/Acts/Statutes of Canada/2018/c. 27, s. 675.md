**Designation**

**5** 

- **(1)** If the governing body of a First Nation has requested that the Minister set apart certain lands as a reserve, the First Nation may designate, conditionally or unconditionally, any interest or right in or to the lands, including for the purpose of the replacement of an existing interest or right in or to those lands. The designation may be made either
	- **(a)** before the title to the lands or the administration and control of the lands are transferred to Her Majesty in right of Canada; or
	- **(b)** before the lands are set apart as a reserve under section 4.

**Authorization — transfer or grant**

**7** 

- **(1)** If the governing body of a First Nation has requested that the Minister set apart certain lands as a reserve and an Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature authorizes Her Majesty in right of a province, a municipal or local authority or a corporation to take or to use lands or any interest or right in lands without the consent of the owner, the Minister may authorize, with the consent of the governing body, a transfer or grant of any of the lands that the governing body has requested be set apart as a reserve, or any interest or right in or to those lands, to a province, authority or corporation, subject to any terms that may be prescribed by the Minister.
