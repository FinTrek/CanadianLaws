**Preamble**

Whereas section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination based on sex;

Whereas the [Canadian Human Rights Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/H/H-6.md) provides that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression;

Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes the systemic and historical inequalities faced by women and girls, and gender-diverse people or those people of diverse sexual orientation;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which provides that the rights and freedoms recognized in that declaration are guaranteed equally to Indigenous individuals, regardless of sex;

Whereas Canada ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, in which the state parties condemn all discrimination against women, meaning any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex and Canada recognizes United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 32/2 which reaffirms protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to advancing gender equality through policies and programs that are compatible with Canada’s international obligations and take into account sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression;

And whereas the Government of Canada is committed to assessing the impact of those policies and programs on groups of women, men and gender-diverse people by taking into consideration the intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors and to taking actions that contribute to an inclusive and democratic society and allow all Canadians to participate fully in all spheres of their lives;
