## Rules About Violations



**Certain defences not available**

**11** 

- **(1)** A person, ship or vessel named in a notice of violation does not have a defence by reason that the person or, in the case of a ship or vessel, its owner, operator, master or chief engineer
	- **(a)** exercised due diligence to prevent the violation; or
	- **(b)** reasonably and honestly believed in the existence of facts that, if true, would exonerate the person, ship or vessel.

**Common law principles**

- **(2)** Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse in relation to a charge for an offence under an Environmental Act applies in respect of a violation to the extent that it is not inconsistent with this Act.




**Continuing violation**

**12** A violation that is committed or continued on more than one day constitutes a separate violation for each day on which it is committed or continued.




**Violation or offence**

**13** 

- **(1)** Proceeding with any act or omission as a violation under this Act precludes proceeding with it as an offence under an Environmental Act, and proceeding with it as an offence under an Environmental Act precludes proceeding with it as a violation under this Act.

**Violations not offences**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, a violation is not an offence and, accordingly, section 126 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) does not apply in respect of a violation.




**Limitation period**

**Enforcement of summonses and orders**

- **(2)** Any summons issued or order made under subsection (1) may be made a summons or an order of the Federal Court or of the superior court of a province and is enforceable in the same manner as a summons or an order of that court.

## Responsibility
