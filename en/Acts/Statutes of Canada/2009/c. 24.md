Assented to on 23 June 2009

----------




**Preamble**

Whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes the objective of protecting the health and safety of the public;

Whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that human pathogens and toxins pose varying levels of risk to the health and safety of the public;

Whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that a lack of full scientific certainty regarding the risks posed by certain human pathogens and toxins is not to be used as a reason to postpone measures that protect the health and safety of the public;

And whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that human pathogens and toxins evolve and can be altered and that new human pathogens and toxins appear continually, therefore creating unique challenges in meeting the objective of protecting the health and safety of the public;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
