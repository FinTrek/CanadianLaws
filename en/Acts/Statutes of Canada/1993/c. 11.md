**6.02****TRANSFER OF BEDS AND SHORES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES:**



Saskatchewan agrees to give favourable consideration to offers from an Entitlement Band to Purchase the beds and shores of any Waterbody adjacent to Entitlement Land. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as requiring Saskatchewan to sell the beds and shores of such Waterbodies.



**6.03****RESERVE BOUNDARIES:**



Where Entitlement Land adjacent to a Waterbody is set apart as an Entitlement Reserve, the parties agree that:



**(a)** the boundary of the Entitlement Reserve shall be the ordinary high water mark for such Waterbody;



**(b)** the Entitlement Reserve shall not include within its boundaries any portion of the bed or the shore of the Waterbody below the ordinary high water mark unless Saskatchewan has expressly agreed to transfer the beds and shores in accordance with section 6.02; and



**(c)** subject to compliance with the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-22, the Entitlement Band shall have the right to place a dock, wharf or pier on the bed of the Waterbody along the boundary of any such Waterbody which is adjacent to an Entitlement Reserve, without needing to obtain any licence or to pay any fee or compensation whatsoever.



**6.04****RIPARIAN RIGHTS:**



The Entitlement Band shall, immediately upon creation of an Entitlement Reserve, have full common law riparian rights with respect to the use and occupation of that Entitlement Reserve adjacent to a Waterbody, but, for greater certainty, the principle of *ad medium filium* aquae shall be inapplicable unless the affected beds and shores have otherwise been acquired by the Entitlement Band under section 6.02.



**6.05****NON-ENFORCEMENT OF RIPARIAN RIGHTS IN CERTAIN CASES:**



**(a)** Where an Entitlement Reserve is established adjacent to a Waterbody, the Entitlement Bands agree with Canada and Saskatchewan that the common law riparian rights referred to in section 6.04 shall be unenforceable by injunction, mandamus, prohibition, or similar prerogative writ for the purposes of preventing or delaying any Water Project provided that:



**(i)** Canada, and any Entitlement Band whose common law riparian rights have been affected, were notified at least six (6) months in advance of any decision in relation to the approval of any Water Project; and



**(ii)** any Entitlement Band whose common law riparian rights have been affected by any such Water Project shall have been afforded active and meaningful participation in any decision by a decision making authority concerned with the approval or operation of any such Water Project.



**(b)** The parties agree that nothing in this section limits the right of an Entitlement Band to seek or obtain monetary compensation from Saskatchewan (including costs associated with obtaining such compensation) for damages suffered as the result of any interference with, loss of, or damage to, an Entitlement Band’s common law riparian rights.



**6.06****ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND CONSIDERATION OF INDIAN USE:**



**(a)** Where any Water Project may, in the opinion of an Entitlement Band, reasonably be expected in a discernible way to adversely affect an Entitlement Band’s common law riparian rights, the Entitlement Band and Canada and/or Saskatchewan, as the case may be, agree to jointly review or, if applicable, jointly conduct any environmental impact assessments or other studies concerning the effects, or possible effects, of any Water Project as may be statutorily required.



**(b)** Canada and/or Saskatchewan, as the case may be, agree to jointly review or, if applicable, jointly conduct the same with the affected Entitlement Bands in a manner which takes due consideration of the Entitlement Bands’ riparian rights and usage of any affected Waterbody by the Entitlement Bands, or the Members of such Entitlement Bands, for hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering or other traditional uses.



**6.07****AGREEMENT AMONGST PARTIES:**



Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, but subject to applicable legislation, Saskatchewan and any Entitlement Band may enter into a Co-Management Agreement concerning the management and use of all or any portion of a particular Waterbody adjacent to an Entitlement Reserve (including its water, bed and shore) affecting the Entitlement Band’s common law riparian rights, which meets the needs and objectives of all parties.



**6.08****CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT:**



**(a)** The Co-Management Agreement shall address matters affecting, in a discernible way, the quantity, quality, or rate of flow of waters in a Waterbody in respect of which an Entitlement Band has riparian rights and may provide for any matters related to the use, management or development of the Waterbody. In particular, such an agreement may provide for the following:

**(iii)** the establishment of a Co-Management Board to make binding decisions with respect to Waterbodies and Water Projects.



**(b)** In no event shall the entering into of a Co-Management Agreement be a condition precedent to the sale of any Crown Land, Minerals or Improvements hereunder.



**6.09****CO-MANAGEMENT BOARD:**



In the event that the Entitlement Band and Saskatchewan agree pursuant to a Co-Management Agreement that a Co-Management Board be established, the following principles shall apply:



**(a)** the Entitlement Band and Saskatchewan shall be represented on the Co-Management Board by an equal number of members except in cases where the interest of the Entitlement Band *vis-à-vis* the interest of other users of the water does not warrant equal representation, in which case the respective representation of the Entitlement Band and Saskatchewan on the Co-Management Board shall be agreed upon by the Entitlement Band and Saskatchewan;



**(b)** in the event that there is no agreement on the representation of the Entitlement Band and Saskatchewan on the Co-Management Board, it shall be referred to the Arbitration Board; and



**(c)** the Co-Management Board shall have the authority to review and either approve, wholly or on terms and conditions, or disapprove, of any Water Project within its jurisdiction.



**6.10****MINISTER’S CONSENT MAY BE REQUIRED:**



Subject to applicable legislation, each of the Entitlement Bands and Saskatchewan acknowledge that the Minister’s consent may be required pursuant to the Act to give effect to any Co-Management Agreement. To the extent such consent is required, each of the Entitlement Bands and Saskatchewan agree that such consent shall be obtained prior to execution and delivery of any Co-Management Agreement.



**6.11****NO EFFECT ON TREATY RIGHTS:**



Any provision of this Article which is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to conflict with or derogate from Treaty rights of any Entitlement Band or its Members shall, to the extent of such conflict or derogation, be deemed to be null and void and of no further force or effect whatsoever.
