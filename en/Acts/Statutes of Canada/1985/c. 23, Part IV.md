*Article X*
### Dividends


**1** Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.



**2** However, such dividends may be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is a company which is the beneficial owner of the dividends and which holds an equity percentage of at least 10 per cent in the company paying the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.

In such a case, the provisions of Article VII shall apply.



**4** The term ***dividends*** as used in this Article means income from shares, “*jouissance*” shares or “*jouissance*” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.



**5** Notwithstanding any provision of this Convention:

**6** Where a company is a resident of a Contracting State, the other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to any tax, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.



**7** The tax rate limitations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 5(b) of this Article shall not apply to dividends or profits paid before the end of the third calendar year following the year of signature of this Convention.

**1** Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

**(a)** 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest arising in Brazil and paid to a resident of Canada in respect of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation of Canada for a minimum period of 7 years;



**(b)** 15 per cent in all other cases.





**3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to the Government of the other Contracting State, a political subdivision thereof or any agency (including a financial institution) wholly owned by that Government, or political subdivision shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned Contracting State.



**4** The term ***interest*** as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises. However, the term ***interest*** does not include income dealt with in Article X such as income from debt-claims which corresponds to a participation in the debtor’s profits.



**5** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the recipient of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, has in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises a permanent establishment with which the debt-claim from which the interest arises is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article VII shall apply.



**6** The limitation established in paragraph 2 shall not apply to interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of the other Contracting State which is situated in a third State.



**7** Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that Contracting State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.



**8** Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

**2** However, such royalties may be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is a company which is the beneficial owner of the royalties, the tax so charged shall not exceed:

**(a)** 25 per cent of the gross amount of royalties arising from the use of, or the right to use trade marks;



**(b)** 15 per cent in all other cases.





**3** The term ***royalties*** as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work (including cinematograph films, films or tapes for television or radio broadcasting), any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.



**4** Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are born by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.



**5** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the recipient of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, has in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, a permanent establishment with which the right or property giving rise to the royalties is effectively connected. In such a case, the provisions of Article VII shall apply.



**6** Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the recipient or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the recipient in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.



**7** The tax rate limitation referred to in paragraph 2(b) shall not apply to royalties paid before the end of the fourth calendar year following the calendar year in which this Convention enters into force where such royalties are paid to a resident of a Contracting State which holds, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the voting capital of the company paying the royalties.



*Article XIII*
### Gains from the Alienation of Property

### Methods for the Elimination of Double Taxation


**1** Where a resident of Brazil derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Canada, Brazil shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that person, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Canada. The deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the income which may be taxed in Canada.



**2** Unless the provisions of paragraph 4 or 5 apply, where a resident of Canada derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Brazil, Canada shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that person, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Brazil, including business-income tax and non-business-income-tax. The deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the income which may be taxed in Brazil.



**3** For the deduction indicated in paragraph 2, Brazilian tax shall always be considered as having been paid at the rate of 25 per cent of the gross amount of the profits to which paragraph 5(b) of Article X applies and at the rate of 20 per cent of the gross amount of the income paid in Brazil in the case of interest to which paragraph 2 of Article XI applies and royalties to which paragraph 2(b) of Article XII applies.



**4** Dividends received by a company which is a resident of Canada from a company which is a resident of Brazil shall be exempt from tax in Canada if the company receiving the dividends holds an equity percentage of at least 10 per cent in the company paying the dividends and if the profits out of which the dividends are paid are derived from carrying on an active business in Brazil or in a country with which Canada has concluded a double taxation convention; for the purposes of this provision, any income from sources in a country other than Canada which pertains to or is incident to an active business carried on in a country other than Canada, shall be deemed to be profits derived from carrying on an active business.



**5** Where a company which is a resident of Canada derives dividends, other than those mentioned in paragraph 4, from a company which is a resident of Brazil in which it holds an equity percentage of at least 10 per cent and those dividends may be taxed in Brazil, in accordance with this Convention, Canada shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of the first-mentioned company an amount equal to the income tax paid in Brazil and shall allow relief in respect of the Brazilian corporation tax paid on the profits out of which the dividends are paid; the deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Canadian income tax as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the dividends.

For the deduction mentioned in this paragraph, Brazilian tax on dividends shall always be considered as having been paid at the rate of 25 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends.





**6** The value of the shares issued by a corporation of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subject to income tax in the last-mentioned State.

*Article XXIII*
### Non-Discrimination

**2** The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

**3** Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected.

**2** The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention.



**3** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.



**4** The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

The competent authorities of the Contracting States may also settle by mutual agreement the methods of application of this Convention.

### Exchange of Information


**1** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Convention and of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by this Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is in accordance with this Convention. Any information so exchanged shall be treated as secret and shall not be disclosed to any persons or authorities other than those concerned with the assessment or collection of the taxes which are the subject of the Convention.
