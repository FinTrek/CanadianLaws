**Preamble**

WHEREAS the Governor in Council in consequence of the explosion on December 6, 1917 at Halifax constituted the Halifax Relief Commission to administer the relief funds contributed for the assistance of those who suffered as a result of the explosion;

AND WHEREAS the said Commission was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly of Nova Scotia entitled An Act to Incorporate the Halifax Relief Commission, which was confirmed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada entitled An Act respecting the Halifax Relief Commission;

AND WHEREAS the Government of Nova Scotia intends, in view of the diminished role of the Halifax Relief Commission, to introduce into the General Assembly of Nova Scotia a measure for the dissolution of the Commission and the transfer of its assets to the Minister of Finance of Canada, and it is therefore expedient that the Parliament of Canada enact a measure to authorize the Minister of Finance to accept those assets and the Canadian Pension Commission to continue the payment of pensions, grants or allowances to those who suffered as a result of the explosion;
