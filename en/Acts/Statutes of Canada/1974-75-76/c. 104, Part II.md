**1** The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.



**2** Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment and with all other associated persons.



**3** In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed those deductible expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.



**4** In the absence of appropriate accounting or other data permitting the determination of the amount of the profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State which is attributable to its permanent establishment situated in the other State, the tax may, in particular, be charged in that other State in accordance with its domestic legislation, having regard to the normal profits of similar enterprises engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions.



**5** No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.



**6** For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.



**7** Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.



**Article 8** 
### Shipping and Air Transport


**1** Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.



**2** Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, profits which are not covered by paragraph 1 and which are derived from the operation of ships used to transport passengers or goods exclusively between places in a Contracting State may be taxed in that State.



**3** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.



**4** In this Article,

**(a)** the term ***profits*** includes interest on funds directly connected with the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic, provided that such interest is incidental to the operation;



**(b)** the term ***operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic*** includes:

**(i)** the charter or rental of ships or aircraft, or



**(ii)** the rental of containers and related equipment,



by an enterprise of a Contracting State, provided that such charter or rental is incidental to the operation by that enterprise of ships or aircraft in international traffic.







**Article 9** 
### Associated Enterprises


**1** Where

**(a)** an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or



**(b)** the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,



and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any income or profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the income or profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.





**2** Where a Contracting State includes in the income or profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — income or profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the income or profits so included are income or profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make such an adjustment as it considers appropriate to the amount of tax charged therein on that income or those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention.



**3** A Contracting State shall not change the income or profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after six years from the end of the year in which the income or profits which would be subject to such change would have accrued to an enterprise of that State.



**4** The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default.



**Article 10** 
### Dividends


**1** Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.



**2** However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State the tax so charged shall not exceed:

**(a)** 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which owns directly at least 10 per cent of the voting stock of the company paying the dividends;



**(b)** 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.



This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.





**3** The term ***dividends*** as used in this Article means income from shares, “**jouissance**” shares or “**jouissance**” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income — even paid in the form of interest — which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the payment is a resident.



**4** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.



**5** Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.



**6** Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on the earnings attributable to permanent establishments in Canada of a company which is a resident of Belgium, in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of Canada, provided that the rate of any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term ***earnings*** means profits attributable to such permanent establishments in Canada (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 13, of such permanent establishments) in accordance with Article 7 in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom:

**(a)** business losses attributable to such permanent establishments (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such permanent establishments) in such year and previous years;



**(b)** all taxes chargeable in Canada on such profits, other than the additional tax referred to herein;



**(c)** the profits reinvested in Canada, provided that the amount of such deduction shall be determined in accordance with the existing provisions, of the law of Canada regarding the computation of the allowance in respect of investment in property in Canada, and any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof; and



**(d)** five hundred thousand Canadian dollars ($500,000), less any amount deducted:

**(i)** by the company, or



**(ii)** by a person related thereto from the same or a similar business as that carried on by the company,



under this subparagraph (d); for the purposes of this subparagraph (d), a company is related to another company if one company directly or indirectly controls the other, or both companies are directly or indirectly controlled by the same person or persons, or if the two companies deal with each other not at arm’s length.







**Article 11** 
### Interest


**1** Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.



**2** However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.



**3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State if it is:

**(a)** interest paid with respect to indebtedness in connection with the sale on credit by a resident of that other State of any equipment, merchandise or services, except where the sale or indebtedness was between related persons;



**(b)** interest paid to the other Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof;



**(c)** interest on a loan made, guaranteed or insured or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by Export Development Canada in the case of Canada or by any similar institution specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States in the case of Belgium.





**4** The term ***interest*** as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises; however, the term ***interest*** does not include for the purpose of this Article penalty charges for late payment, interest referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 8 nor interest dealt with in paragraph 3 of Article 10.



**5** The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.



**6** Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.



**7** Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable in the Contracting State in which the interest arises according to the laws of that State.



**Article 12** 
### Royalties


**1** Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.



**2** However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.



**3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2,

**(a)** copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or other artistic work (but not including royalties in respect of motion picture films nor royalties in respect of works on film or videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television broadcasting); and



**(b)** royalties for the use of, or the right to use, computer software or any patent or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience (but not including any such information provided in connection with a rental or franchise agreement),



arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State.





**4** The term ***royalties*** as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including payments of any kind in respect of motion picture films and works on film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process or other intangible property, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.



**5** The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.



**6** Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.



**7** Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable in the Contracting State in which the royalties arise, according to the laws of that State.



**Article 13** 
### Capital Gains

**(a)** shares (other than shares listed on an approved stock exchange in the other Contracting State) forming part of a substantial interest in the capital stock of a company which is a resident of either Contracting State, the value of which shares is derived principally from immovable property situated in the other State; or



**(b)** a substantial interest in a partnership, trust or estate, established under the law in either Contracting State, the value of which is derived principally from immovable property situated in the other State,



may be taxed in that other State. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ***immovable property*** includes the shares of a company referred to in subparagraph (a) or an interest in a partnership, trust or estate referred to in subparagraph (b) but does not include any property, other than rental property, in which the business of the company, partnership, trust or estate is carried on.

**6** Where an individual who ceases to be a resident of a Contracting State, and immediately thereafter becomes a resident of the other Contracting State, is treated for the purposes of taxation in the first-mentioned State as having alienated a property and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for purposes of taxation in the other State as if the individual had, immediately before becoming a resident of that State, sold and repurchased the property for an amount equal to its fair market value at that time. However, this provision shall not apply to property, which would give rise, if it were alienated immediately before the individual became a resident of that other State, to a gain, which may be taxed in that other State nor to immovable property situated in a third State.



**Article 14** 
### Independent Personal Services


**1** Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless the individual has a fixed base regularly available in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing the activities. If the individual has or had such a fixed base, the income may be taxed in the other State but only so much of it as is attributable to that fixed base.

**2** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:

**(a)** the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned; and

**(c)** the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State.





**3** Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State may be taxed in that State.



**Article 16** 
### Company Managers


**1** Director’s fees and similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that resident’s capacity as a member of the board of directors or a similar organ of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

This provision shall also apply to payments derived in respect of the discharge of functions which, under the laws of the Contracting State of which the company is a resident, are regarded as functions of a similar nature as those exercised by a member of a board of directors or a similar organ of a company.





**2** Remuneration derived by a person referred to in paragraph 1 from a company which is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of the discharge of day-to-day functions of a managerial or technical nature may be taxed in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 as if such remuneration were remuneration derived by an employee in respect of an employment and as if references to the “employer” were references to the company.



**Article 17** 
### Artistes and Sports Persons


**1** Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, a musician, or as a sports person, from that resident’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.



**2** Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sports person in that individual’s capacity as such accrues not to that entertainer or sports person personally but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sports person are exercised.



**3** The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the entertainer or the sports person establishes that neither the individual nor any person associated with the individual participates directly or indirectly in the profits of the person referred to in that paragraph.



**Article 18** 
### Pensions

**1** 

**(a)** Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.



**(b)** However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the recipient is a resident of that State who:

**(i)** is a national of that State; or



**(ii)** did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of performing the services.

**Article 21** 
### Other Income


**1** Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State.



**2** However, if such income is derived by a resident of a Contracting State from sources in the other Contracting State, such income may also be taxed in the State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State. Where such income is income from an estate or a trust, other than a trust to which contributions were deductible, the tax so charged shall, provided that the income is taxable in the Contracting State in which the beneficial owner is a resident, not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the income.

### V. Methods for Prevention of Double Taxation


**Article 23** 
### Elimination of Double Taxation


**1** In the case of Belgium, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

**(a)** When a resident of Belgium derives income or owns elements of capital which are taxed in Canada in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, other than those of paragraph 2 of Article 10, of paragraphs 2 and 7 of Article 11, of paragraphs 2 and 7 of Article 12 and of the second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 21, Belgium shall exempt such income or such elements of capital from tax but may, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of that resident, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if such income or elements of capital had not been exempted.



**(b)** Subject to the provisions of Belgian law regarding the deduction from Belgian tax of taxes paid abroad, where a resident of Belgium derives items of his aggregate income for Belgian tax purposes which are dividends taxable in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 10 and not exempt from Belgian tax according to subparagraph (c) hereinafter, interest taxable in accordance with paragraph 2 or 7 of Article 11, royalties taxable in accordance with paragraph 2 or 7 of Article 12, the Canadian tax levied on that income shall be allowed as a credit against Belgian tax relating to such income.



**(c)** Dividends derived by a company which is a resident of Belgium from a company which is a resident of Canada and which may be taxed in Canada in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 10, shall be exempt from the corporate income tax in Belgium under the conditions and within the limits provided for in Belgian law.



**(d)** When, in accordance with Belgian law, losses incurred by an enterprise carried on by a resident of Belgium in a permanent establishment situated in Canada, have been effectively deducted from the profits of that enterprise for its taxation in Belgium, the exemption provided for in subparagraph (a) shall not apply in Belgium to the profits of other taxable periods attributable to that establishment to the extent that those profits have also been exempted from tax in Canada by reason of compensation for the said losses.



**(e)** When a resident of Belgium derives income to which the provisions of the second sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 21 apply and which has been taxed in Canada, the amount of Belgian tax proportionately attributable to such income shall not exceed the amount which would be charged according to Belgian law if such income were taxed as earned income derived from sources outside Belgium and subject to foreign tax.





**2** In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

**(a)** Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions (which shall not affect the general principle hereof) and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided for under the laws of Canada, tax payable in Belgium on profits, income or gains arising in Belgium shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains.



**(b)** Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the taxation of income from a foreign affiliate and to any subsequent modification of those provisions for the purposes of computing Canadian tax, a company which is a resident of Canada shall be allowed to deduct in computing its taxable income any dividend received by it out of the exempt surplus of a foreign affiliate which is a resident of Belgium.



**(c)** Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income or capital, take into account the exempted income or capital.



**(d)** For the purposes of this paragraph, profits, income or gains of a resident of Canada, which may be taxed in Belgium in accordance with the Convention shall be deemed to arise in Belgium.





### VI. Special Provisions


**Article 24** 
### Non-discrimination


**1** Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to individuals who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.



**2** The taxation on a permanent establishment, which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.



**3** Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 or of paragraph 7 of Article 12, apply, royalties paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.



**4** In this Article, the term ***taxation*** means the taxes which are the subject of this Convention.



**Article 25** 
### Mutual Agreement Procedure


**1** Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present the case in writing to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident, or if the case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. To be admissible, the said case must be presented within two years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.



**2** The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention.



**3** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.



**4** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall agree on administrative measures necessary to carry out the provisions of the Convention and particularly on the proofs to be furnished by residents of either Contracting State in order to benefit in the other State from the exemptions or reductions in tax provided for in the Convention.



**5** The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate directly with each other for the application of the Convention.



**6** For purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.



**Article 26** 
### Exchange of Information


**1** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning all taxes imposed on behalf of the Contracting States insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to taxes. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.



**2** In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

**(a)** to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(b)** to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(c)** to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (*ordre public*).





**Article 27** 
### Miscellaneous Provisions


**1** Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of a diplomatic mission or consular post under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.



**2** The provisions of the Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction now or hereafter accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State.



**3** Nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of Canada with respect to a trust in which that resident has an interest or with respect to a controlled foreign affiliate, in accordance with section 91 of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md) of Canada as it may be amended without changing the general principle hereof.

The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply:

**(a)** if the royalties are derived in connection with or incidental to the active conduct of a trade or business carried on in the State which is not a Contracting State; or



**(b)** when Belgium is the State of residence of the enterprise, to royalties taxed by Canada according to section 91 of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md), as it may be amended without changing the general principle hereof.





**6** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 11 and of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 12, interest and royalties (other than royalties to which paragraph 5 applies) arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the first-mentioned State at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest and 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties, where:

**(a)** such interest or royalties are received by a company and one or more persons not resident in that other Contracting State hold directly or indirectly, through one or more companies or otherwise, at least 50 per cent of the capital of such company and, directly or indirectly, exercise the management of, or control such company; and



**(b)** such interest or royalties are not subject to tax in the other State under the ordinary rules of its tax law.
