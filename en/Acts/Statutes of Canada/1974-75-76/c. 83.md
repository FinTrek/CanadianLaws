## Increased Rate of Return



**Increased interest for deferred annuities**

**3** 

- **(1)** In determining the value of an annuity prior to the date on which it becomes payable, the rate or rates of interest to be used shall, for the period before April 1st, 1975, be the rate or rates of interest applicable to that annuity contract and, for the period commencing April 1st, 1975, shall, subject to subsection (2), be seven per cent per annum.

**Governor in Council may vary interest rate**

- **(2)** The Governor in Council may by regulation vary, in respect of any annuity or category of annuities, the seven per cent rate of interest mentioned in subsection (1), but the rate of interest fixed by regulation may not, in respect of any annuity, be lower than the rate or rates of interest applicable to that annuity prior to April 1st, 1975.




**Calculation of amount of annuity**

**4** At the date on which an annuity becomes payable, if that date is on or after April 1st, 1975, the amount of annuity payable shall be calculated by using the value of that annuity determined in accordance with section 3 and the table or tables of values prescribed under paragraph 13(b) of the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md) applicable to that annuity contract.




**Annuity payments to be increased**

**5** 

- **(1)** All amounts payable by way of an annuity on or after April 1st, 1975 shall be increased by the applicable percentage or percentages shown in the schedule.

**Amendment of schedule**

- **(2)** The Governor in Council may, by regulation, amend the schedule in respect of any annuity or category of annuities.




**Maximum annuity max exceed $1,200 per year**

**6** 

- **(1)** Notwithstanding subsection 8(1) of the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md), the total amount payable by way of an annuity or annuities to any annuitant or to joint annuitants may exceed twelve hundred dollars a year to the extent that such excess results from the application of section 3 or 5 or both.

**Regulations may permit further increase in maximum**

- **(2)** The Governor in Council may make regulations for permitting the total amount payable by way of annuity or annuities to any annuitant or to joint annuitants to exceed the maximum permitted by subsection (1).




## Increased Flexibility



**Variation and substitution**

**7** The Minister may, upon such terms and conditions as are prescribed by regulation,
- **(a)** vary an existing annuity contract with the consent of the purchaser; or
- **(b)** substitute a new annuity contract for an existing one where there is a change of purchaser.




**When purchaser dies or goes out of existence**

**8** Where an annuity contract under the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md) does not permit the annuitant to request changes in his annuity without the purchaser’s consent and the purchaser has died or gone out of existence, the annuitant has the same right to request changes in his annuity as had the purchaser.




**Commutation available in certain cases**

**9** When, under an annuity contract under the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md), the annuity is payable for a term of years certain or for the life of the annuitant, whichever period is the longer, and the annuitant has died before the expiration of that term of years certain, then, notwithstanding subsection 12(2) of the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md), the remaining instalments may, at the request of the purchaser or his legal representative, be commuted into a lump sum payment, the amount of which shall be calculated in accordance with the regulations.

**10** The interest referred to in subsection 12(1) of the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md) shall accrue to the date of repayment in cases where the relevant death occurs after the commencement of this Act, even if the annuity contract stipulates that the interest will accrue only to the date of death.




**Rate of interest in certain cases**

**11** Notwithstanding the provisions of The Appropriation Act No. 4, 1950, Vote 695, and of Appropriation Act No. 6, 1960, Vote 526, the interest mentioned in those Votes shall, after March 31st, 1975, accrue at a rate determined from time to time by the Governor in Council.
