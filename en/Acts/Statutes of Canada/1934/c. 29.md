**Preamble R.S., 1886, c. 44; R.S., 1927, c. 98 R.S., 1886, c. 43**





WHEREAS by Order in Council of the fifth March, 1889 (P.C. 466), the provisions of The Indian Advancement Act, being chapter forty-four of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, were applied to the Iroquois Indians of Caughnawaga in the province of Quebec, and, for the purpose of giving effect to the application of the said Act, the reserve at Caughnawaga was designated the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, and was divided into six sections, as therein set out; and whereas by Order in Council of the 12th July, 1906 (P.C. 1419), in the purported exercise of the powers conferred by section four of The Indian Advancement Act, as enacted by section one of chapter thirty of the statutes of 1890, it was provided that the division of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve into sections be done away with, and that the said reserve be comprised in one section; and whereas it appears that there was no provision of The Indian Act or of any other statute authorizing the making of the last mentioned Order in Council, and that the same was and is, therefore, void and of no effect; and whereas it is expedient that anything duly done or suffered pursuant to the provisions of the said last mentioned Order in Council be validated, and that provision be made for again dividing the reserve into six sections: Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






**Acts and proceedings validated**

**1** All acts committed, proceedings taken or things done or suffered under or pursuant to the provisions of the said Order in Council of the 12th July, 1906 (P.C. 1419), are hereby declared to have been valid and effective to all intents and purposes as if the said Order in Council had been lawfully made.



**2** [Amendment to another Act]
