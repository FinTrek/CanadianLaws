**Preamble**

Whereas the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md) is an outdated colonial statute, the application of which results in the people of Canada’s First Nations being subjected to differential treatment;

Whereas the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md) does not provide an adequate legislative framework for the development of self-sufficient and prosperous First Nations’ communities;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to the development of new legislation to replace the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md) that better reflects the modern relationship between it and the people of Canada’s First Nations;

And whereas the Government of Canada is committed to continuing its work in exploring creative options for the development of this new legislation in collaboration with the First Nations that have demonstrated an interest in this work;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada enacts as follows:






## Short Title
