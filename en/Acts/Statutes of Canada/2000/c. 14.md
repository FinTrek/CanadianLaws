**Tax on specific supplies**

**24** 

- **(1)** Despite section 87 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md), the council of a band listed in the schedule may make a by-law imposing a direct tax in respect of taxable supplies of alcoholic beverages, fuel or tobacco products made on the reserves of the band at the rates at which tax is imposed under subsections 165(1) and (3) of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) in respect of those supplies.

**Collection of tax**

- **(2)** A direct tax imposed under a by-law made under subsection (1) shall be collected pursuant to an administration agreement entered into under subsection 26(1).

**Supply on a reserve**

- **(3)** For the purposes of subsection (1), a supply is made on a reserve only if
	- **(a)** tax under section 165 of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) is not payable in respect of the supply because of the connection of the supply with the reserve and the application of section 87 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md); or
	- **(b)** tax under section 165 of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) would not be payable in respect of the supply for the reasons set out in paragraph (a) if the recipient of the supply were eligible for exemption from taxation under section 87 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md).




**Application of section 87 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md)**

**25** 

- **(1)** For greater certainty, except in respect of a tax imposed by a by-law made under subsection 24(1), nothing in that subsection affects the application of section 87 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md).

**Indian moneys**

- **(2)** Moneys raised pursuant to a direct tax imposed under subsection 24(1) are not Indian moneys within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md).

**Expenditures**

- **(3)** Expenditures made out of moneys raised pursuant to a tax imposed under a by-law made under subsection 24(1) must be made under the authority of a resolution approved by a majority of councillors present at a meeting of the council of a band that is duly convened.

**By-law**

- **(4)** A by-law made under subsection 24(1)
	- **(a)** is valid only if approved by a majority of councillors present at a meeting of the council of a band that is duly convened;
	- **(b)** does not come into force before it has been received by the Minister and an administration agreement has been entered into under subsection 26(1);
	- **(c)** shall provide that the rates of tax under the by-law are those at which tax is imposed under subsections 165(1) and (3) of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md);
	- **(d)** may be made in respect of any matter arising out of or ancillary to the exercise of powers under this subsection; and
	- **(e)** is not subject to the [Statutory Instruments Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-22.md).

**Proof of by-law**

- **(5)** A copy of a by-law made under this Part, if it is certified to be a true copy by the Minister or a person authorized by the Minister, is evidence that the by-law was duly made by the council of a band and received by the Minister, without proof of the signature or the authorization of the person, and no such by-law is invalid by reason of any defect in form.

**Publication**

- **(6)** The council of a band shall, on demand, provide a copy of any by-law made by the council under this Part and shall publish a copy of every such by-law in a newspaper that has general circulation in the place where the tax applies and in the First Nations Gazette, but no by-law shall be invalid by reason of a failure to publish it.




**Agreement with Government of Canada**

**26** 

- **(1)** If the council of a band has made a by-law imposing a tax under this Part, the council may enter into an administration agreement within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the [Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20F-6.md) in respect of the by-law.

**Rules where agreement**

- **(2)** If the council of a band has entered into an administration agreement under subsection (1) in respect of a by-law,
	- **(a)** Part IX of, and Schedules V, VI and VII to, the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) apply for the purposes of the by-law as if the tax imposed under the by-law were imposed under section 165 of that Act;
	- **(b)** Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) applies for all other purposes as if the by-law were part of that Part and the tax imposed under the by-law were imposed under that Part;
	- **(c)** the by-law applies as if Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) were part of the by-law and tax imposed under that Part were imposed under the by-law;
	- **(d)** for greater certainty,
		- **(i)** where a person does anything to satisfy a requirement of the by-law that would satisfy a corresponding requirement of Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) if the tax imposed under the by-law were imposed under section 165 of that Act, the requirement of the by-law is deemed to have been satisfied,
		- **(ii)** where a person does anything to exercise an authority under the by-law that would be a valid exercise of a corresponding authority under Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) if the tax imposed under the by-law were imposed under section 165 of that Act, the authority under the by-law is deemed to have been validly exercised, and
		- **(iii)** every person who is a registrant for the purposes of Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) is a registrant for the purposes of the by-law; and
	- **(e)** any proceeding that could be taken under any other Act of Parliament in respect of the tax imposed under section 165 of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) may be taken in respect of the tax imposed under the by-law.




**Tax under subsection 165(1) of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) not payable**

**27** No tax is payable under subsection 165(1) of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) in respect of a supply if tax is payable in respect of the supply under a by-law made under subsection 24(1).




**Offence**

**28** Where a person commits an act or omission in respect of a by-law made under subsection 24(1) that would be an offence under a provision of Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-15.md) if the act or omission were committed in relation to that Part,
- **(a)** subject to paragraph (b), the person is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction;
- **(b)** the Attorney General of Canada may elect to prosecute the person by indictment where an offence under that provision of that Part may be prosecuted by indictment; and
- **(c)** the person is liable on conviction to the punishment provided for in that provision of that Part.
