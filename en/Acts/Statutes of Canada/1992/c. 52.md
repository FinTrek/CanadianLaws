**Fundamental purpose of sentencing**

**22.07** The fundamental purpose of sentencing for offences under this Act is to contribute, in light of the numerous serious threats to plants and animals and their importance to the environment, to respect for the law regulating international and interprovincial trade in animals and plants through the imposition of just sanctions that have as their objectives
- **(a)** to deter the offender and any other person from committing offences under this Act;
- **(b)** to denounce the unlawful trade in certain animals and plants and to make it unprofitable; and
- **(c)** to recover, if possible, certain species of animals and plants unlawfully traded.
> 2009, c. 14, s. 122.





**Sentencing principles**

	- **(a)** the amount of the fine should be increased to account for every aggravating factor associated with the offence, including the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2); and
	- **(b)** the amount of the fine should reflect the gravity of each aggravating factor associated with the offence.

**Aggravating factors**

- **(2)** The aggravating factors are the following:
	- **(a)** the offence caused damage or risk of damage, directly or indirectly, to animals or plants;

	- **(f)** the offence involved a high degree of planning.

**Absence of aggravating factor**

- **(3)** The absence of an aggravating factor set out in subsection (2) is not a mitigating factor.

**Meaning of damage**

- **(4)** For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(a) and (b), ***damage*** includes loss of use value and non-use value.

**Reasons**

- **(5)** If the court is satisfied of the existence of one or more of the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2) but decides not to increase the amount of the fine because of that factor, the court shall give reasons for that decision.
