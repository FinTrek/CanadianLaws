**32** In carrying out any distribution under subsection 29(3), the Corporation may adjust the appropriate sum determined by the Corporation as provided in this Act for each tonne of grain referred to in that subsection according to grade in order to pay a premium or make a discount in respect of any grain within any grade that
- **(a)** has an inherent quality characteristic that distinguishes it from any other grain within that grade; or
- **(b)** was delivered to the Corporation at a delivery point that the Canadian Grain Commission has determined to be a point at which the average of the aggregate grain of that grade that was delivered to the point during that pool period had an inherent quality characteristic that distinguished it from any other grain within that grade.
