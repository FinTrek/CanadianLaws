**Hearing and decision**

**49** A panel shall, after providing notice to the parties, hold a hearing, at the time and place that the panel considers most appropriate, into the interlocutory issue in respect of which the panel was struck, and make a decision on it.




**Application to strike**

**50** On application by a party to a specific claim, the Tribunal may, at any time in whole or in part, order that the claim be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that it

**Panel for final decision**

**52** On an application under section 50 or 51, or the referral to the Tribunal of an issue of validity or compensation, the Chief Adjudicator shall strike a panel of three or five adjudicators, at least one of whom must be a member in good standing of the bar of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Québec. The Chief Adjudicator shall designate one of them to chair the panel, but the Chief Adjudicator shall chair the panel if he or she is a member of it.




**Hearing and decision**

**53** A panel shall, after providing notice to the parties, hold a hearing, at the time and place that the panel considers most appropriate, into the issue in respect of which the panel was struck, and make a decision on it.




**Limitation**

**54** In deciding an issue of the validity of a specific claim, a panel shall not consider any rule or doctrine that would have the effect of limiting claims or prescribing rights against the Crown because of passage of time or delay.




**Decision on extent of responsibility**

**55** For greater certainty, a panel, in making a decision on the extent of responsibility of each respondent party to a specific claim, may determine that any respondent is, or all the respondents together are, not responsible or not wholly responsible for the claim.




**Basis and limitations for decision on compensation**

**56** 

- **(1)** A panel, in making a decision on an issue of compensation for a specific claim,
	- **(a)** shall calculate the pecuniary losses in relation to the claim, to the prescribed maximum, or, if none is prescribed, to a maximum of ten million dollars, based on principles of compensation applied by courts;
	- **(b)** may not include any amount for
		- **(i)** punitive or exemplary damages, or
		- **(ii)** any harm or loss that is not pecuniary in nature; and
	- **(c)** shall award compensation against each respondent party proportional to the party’s responsibility for the losses calculated under paragraph (a).

**One claim limit for related claims**

- **(2)** Two or more specific claims shall, for the purposes of the application of the claim limit under paragraph (1)(a), be treated as one claim if they
	- **(a)** are made by the same claimant and are based on the same or substantially the same facts; or
	- **(b)** are made by different claimants, are based on the same or substantially the same facts and relate to the same assets.

**Equitable apportionment**

- **(3)** If claims are treated as one claim under paragraph (2)(b), the panel shall apportion equitably among the claimants the total amount awarded.




**Unlawful disposition**

**57** 

- **(1)** If compensation is awarded under this Act for an unlawful disposition of all of the interests or rights of a claimant in or to land and the interests or rights have never been restored to the claimant, then, despite section 39 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md), all the claimant’s interests in, and rights to, the land are extinguished, without prejudice to any right of the claimant to bring any proceeding related to that unlawful disposition against a province that is not a party to the specific claim.

**Unlawful lease**

- **(2)** Despite section 39 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md), if compensation is awarded under this Act in relation to the unexpired period of a lease of land entered into by the Crown in contravention of the rights of the claimant, then, for the duration of that period, the persons who, if the lease had been lawful, would have had any interest in, or right to enjoy, the land are deemed to have that interest or right.




**Acting after termination of appointment**

**58** 

- **(1)** A person who has ceased to be an adjudicator of the Tribunal may, with the authorization of the Chief Adjudicator and for the period that the Chief Adjudicator fixes, take part in the disposition of any matter in which the person became engaged while holding office as an adjudicator, and a person so authorized is, for that purpose, deemed to be an adjudicator.

**If adjudicator unable to act**

- **(2)** If an adjudicator who participates in a panel charged with deciding an issue is, for any reason, unable to take part in the decision, the Chief Adjudicator may, taking into account sections 48 and 52, authorize the remaining adjudicators of the panel to make the decision.




**Notice to others**

**59** 

- **(1)** If a panel’s decision of an issue in relation to a specific claim might, in the opinion of the panel, significantly affect the interests of a province, first nation or person that has not previously been notified of the claim under subsection 36(1), the Tribunal shall so notify them. The parties may make submissions to the panel as to whose interests might be affected.

**Effect of failure to notify**

- **(2)** Failure to provide notice does not invalidate any decision of the panel.

**Confidential hearings**

**Right to cross-examine**

**63** A party may cross-examine a witness
- **(a)** as of right, if the witness is called by a party adverse in interest; and

**Defences of Crown**

**64** Subject to section 54, section 24 of the [Crown Liability and Proceedings Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-50.md) applies in respect of a specific claim as if it were a proceeding.




**Claims to be decided together**

**65** If a panel determines that specific claims are subject to one claim limit under subsection 56(2) or that they present common issues of law or fact that create a risk that decisions on the claims will be irreconcilable, it shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, decide the claims together.




**Suspension**

**66** If a panel, in considering a specific claim, determines that a first nation has a specific claim or a potential specific claim based on the same or substantially the same facts and relating to the same assets as the specific claim, or that there is any other specific claim or potential specific claim by a first nation that must be before the Tribunal to enable a full resolution of the specific claim, it shall suspend proceedings with respect to the specific claim until, in the case of another specific claim, it is before the Tribunal or, in the case of a potential specific claim, it has been filed under this Act and is before the Tribunal.

- **(3)** Despite subsection (2), a decision of a panel that a specific claim is valid is conclusive only under this Act and, except for the purposes of judicial review under subsection (1), any evidence of the decision is inadmissible before any other court or tribunal.

**72** If a panel makes an order that a specific claim is invalid or awards compensation for a specific claim,

## General



**Abandonment**

**74** A specific claim may not be continued if the claimant
- **(a)** commences, before another tribunal or a court, a proceeding against the Crown that is based on the same or substantially the same facts as the claim, or that relates to the same assets as the claim and could result in a decision irreconcilable with that of the claim, unless the claimant immediately has the proceeding adjourned; or
