# An Act to permit the resumption and continuation of the operation of the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River

**S.C. 2007, c. 31**


Assented to on 12 December 2007

----------




**Preamble**

Whereas Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is the operator of the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River, a reactor that is the major producer of medical isotopes in Canada;

Whereas that reactor has been shut down for maintenance purposes and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is prohibited from resuming the operation of the reactor until conditions of its licence relating to earthquake-proof backup units have been complied with;

And whereas the shutdown has created a serious shortage of medical isotopes in Canada and around the world and is putting the health of Canadians at risk;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






**Permission to resume and continue operation**

**1** 

- **(1)** Atomic Energy of Canada Limited may resume and continue the operation of the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River in Ontario for a period of 120 days after the coming into force of this Act despite any conditions of its licence under the [Nuclear Safety and Control Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1997/c.%209.md) relating to the installation of seismically qualified motor starters on the heavy water pumps and the connection to the emergency power supply.

**Safety considerations**

- **(2)** Atomic Energy of Canada Limited may resume and continue the operation of the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River only if it is satisfied that it is safe to do so.




**Authority of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission**

**2** For greater certainty, nothing in this Act derogates from the authority of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in respect of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, except for the specific licence conditions mentioned in subsection 1(1).
