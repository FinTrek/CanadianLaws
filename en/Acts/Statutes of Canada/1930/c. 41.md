# The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act

**S.C. 1930, c. 41**


Assented to on 30 May 1930

----------



His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






**Short title**

**1** This Act may be cited as The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act.




**Agreement confirmed**

**2** The agreement set out in the schedule hereto is hereby approved.




### **SCHEDULE** 
## Memorandum of Agreement
Made this 20th day of March, 1930.

BETWEEN

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA, represented herein by the Honourable Ernest Lapointe, Minister of Justice, and the Honourable Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior,

*Of the first part*,

AND

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN, represented herein by the Honourable James Thomas Milton Anderson, Premier and Minister of Education of the Province, and the Honourable Murdoch Alexander MacPherson, Attorney-General,

*Of the second part*.

Whereas by section twenty-one of the Saskatchewan Act, being chapter forty-two of the four and five Edward the Seventh, it was provided that “All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the Province under the North-West Irrigation Act, 1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said Province with the substitution therein of the said Province for the North-West Territories;”

And whereas the Government of Canada desires that the Province should be placed in a position of equality with the other provinces of Confederation with respect to the administration and control of its natural resources as from its entry into Confederation in 1905;

And whereas the Government of the Province contends that, before the Province was constituted and entered into Confederation as aforesaid, the Parliament of Canada was not competent to enact that the natural resources within the area now included within the boundaries of the Province should vest in the Crown and be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada and was not entitled to administer the said natural resources otherwise than for the benefit of the residents within the said area, and moreover that the Province is entitled to be and should be placed in a position of equality with the other Provinces of Confederation with respect to its natural resources as from the fifteenth day of July, 1870, when Rupert’s Land and the North-Western Territory were admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada:

And whereas it has been agreed between Canada and the said Province that the said section of the Saskatchewan Act should be modified and that provision should be made for the determination of the respective rights and obligations of Canada and the Province as herein set out;

Now Therefore This Agreement Witnesseth:


### Transfer of Public Lands Generally


**1** In order that the Province may be in the same position as the original Provinces of Confederation are in virtue of section one hundred and nine of the British North America Act, 1867, the interest of the Crown in all Crown lands, mines, minerals (precious and base) and royalties derived therefrom within the Province and the interest of the Crown in the waters and water-powers within the Province under the Irrigation Act, being chapter sixty-one of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, as amended by chapter thirty eight, 7-8 Edw. VII, and chapter thirty-four, 9-10 Edw. VII, and under the [Dominion Water Power Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/W/W-4.md), and all sums due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties or for interests or rights in or to the use of such waters or water-powers, shall from and after the coming into force of this agreement and subject as therein otherwise provided, belong to the Province, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Crown in the same, and the said lands, mines, minerals and royalties shall be administered by the Province for the purposes thereof, subject, until the Legislature of the Province otherwise provides, to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada relating to such administration; any payment received by Canada in respect of any such lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement shall continue to belong to Canada whether paid in advance or otherwise, it being the intention that, except as herein otherwise specially provided, Canada shall not be liable to account to the Province for any payment made in respect of any of the said lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement, and that the Province shall not be liable to account to Canada for any such payment made thereafter.
> 1930, c. 41, s. 1; 1938, c. 36, s. 2.




**2** The Province will carry out in accordance with the terms thereof every contract to purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals and every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown, and further agrees not to affect or alter any term of any such contract to purchase, lease or other arrangement by legislation or otherwise, except either with the consent of all the parties thereto other than Canada or in so far as any legislation may apply generally to all similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the Province or to interests therein, irrespective of who may be the parties thereto.



**3** Any power or right, which, by any such contract, lease or other arrangement, or by any Act of the Parliament of Canada relating to any of the lands, mines, minerals or royalties hereby transferred or by any regulation made under any such Act, is reserved to the Governor in Council or to the Minister of the Interior or any other officer of the Government of Canada, may be exercised by such officer of the Government of the Province as may be specified by the Legislature thereof from time to time, and until otherwise directed, may be exercised by the Provincial Secretary of the Province.



**4** The Province will perform every obligation of Canada, arising by virtue of the provisions of any statute or Order in Council or regulation in respect of the public lands to be administered by it hereunder, to any person entitled to a grant of lands by way of subsidy for the construction of railways or otherwise or to any railway company for grants of lands for right of way, road bed, stations, station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards, ballast pits or other appurtenances.



**5** The Province will further be bound by and will, with respect of any lands or interests in lands to which the Hudson’s Bay Company may be entitled, carry out the terms and conditions of the Deed of Surrender from the said Company to the Crown as modified by the Dominion Lands Act and the Agreement dated the 23rd day of December, 1924, between His Majesty and the said Company, which said Agreement was approved by Order in Council dated the 19th day of December, 1924 (P.C. 2158), and in particular the Province will grant to the Company any lands in the Province which the Company may be entitled to select and may select from the lists of lands furnished to the Company by the Minister of the Interior under and pursuant to the said Agreement of the 23rd day of December, 1924, and will release and discharge the reservation in patents referred to in clause three of the said agreement, in case such release and discharge has not been made prior to the coming into force of this agreement. Nothing in this agreement, or in any agreement varying the same as hereinafter provided, shall in any way prejudice or diminish the rights of the Hudson’s Bay Company or affect any right to or interest in land acquired or held by the said Company pursuant to the Deed of Surrender from it to the Crown, the Dominion Lands Act or the said Agreement of the 23rd day of December, 1924.



### School Lands Fund and School Lands


**6** Upon the coming into force of this agreement, Canada will transfer to the Province the money or securities constituting that portion of the school lands fund, created under sections twenty-two and twenty-three of the Act to amend and consolidate the several Acts respecting Public Lands of the Dominion, being chapter thirty-one of forty-two Victoria, and subsequent statutes, which is derived from the disposition of any school lands within the Province or within that part of the Northwest Territories now included within the boundaries thereof.



**7** The school lands fund to be transferred to the Province as aforesaid, and such of the school lands specified in section thirty-seven of the Dominion Lands Act, being chapter one hundred and thirteen of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as pass to the administration of the Province, under the terms hereof, shall be set aside and shall continue to be administered by the Province in accordance, *mutatis mutandis*, with the provisions of sections thirty-seven to forty of the Dominion Lands Act, for the support of schools organized and carried on therein in accordance with the law of the Province. School lands may be sold to veterans qualified to participate in the benefits of the Veterans Land Act, 1942, and amendments thereto, under and subject to terms and conditions to be prescribed by regulations made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The Province will, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, invest money to which this paragraph applies in securities of Canada, or of a Province, or of a municipal corporation, school district or school unit in the Province of Saskatchewan, or in securities guaranteed by Canada or a Province, to form a school fund, and will apply the interest arising therefrom, after deducting the cost of management, for the support of schools organized and carried on in accordance with the law of the Province.
