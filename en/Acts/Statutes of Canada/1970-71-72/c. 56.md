**Amount of grant**

**12** The amount of any grant that may be authorized by the Board to a manufacturer shall neither exceed such amount as may be prescribed nor be greater than any lesser amount that, in the opinion of the Board, would be adequate to maintain employment by the manufacturer throughout the prescribed assistance period at such levels as those prescribed or specified by the Board, as the case may be.




**Levels to be maintained**

**13** No grant shall be paid to a manufacturer in respect of a plant or otherwise for an assistance period unless at the termination of the assistance period, the Board is satisfied that, to the extent that in the opinion of the Board was possible under the circumstances, the manufacturer has maintained the level of employment throughout the assistance period in accordance with the specifications of the Board or at prescribed levels if the Board did not specify any levels of employment for that manufacturer.




**Factors to be considered**

**14** The Board in considering an application by a manufacturer for a grant in respect of a plant or otherwise shall take into account all relevant factors including

**Special case**

**15** 

- **(1)** Where a manufacturer who makes an application under this Act for a grant is unable to comply with any regulations applicable in his case and the Board is of the opinion that a grant to the manufacturer would not be outside the purposes of this Act, as described in section 3, the Board may, having regard to the purposes of this Act, recommend to the Governor in Council that a grant be authorized under this Act for that manufacturer.

**Special grant**

- **(2)** If, following a recommendation under subsection (1), the Governor in Council so directs, the Board may authorize payment of a grant to the manufacturer for an assistance period in such amount as it considers appropriate for the purpose of maintaining employment at a plant of the manufacturer, subject to such terms and conditions, if any, as may be set out in the directions of the Governor in Council.




**Time of payment**
