**Preamble**

Whereas Parliament recognizes that the stability of the financial system in Canada and the maintenance of efficient financial markets are important to the health and strength of the national economy;

Whereas systems established for the clearing and settlement of payment obligations among financial institutions are an essential element of the financial system in Canada and must be properly designed and operated in order to control risk to the financial system in Canada and contribute to its stability;

Whereas the Bank of Canada, in promoting the economic and financial welfare of Canada, takes actions to promote the efficiency and stability of the Canadian financial system, including providing the means of settlement of Canadian dollar payments, acting as lender of last resort and, in consultation with other central banks, developing and implementing standards and practices to recognize and manage risk associated with systems for clearing and settling payment obligations;

And whereas Parliament recognizes that it is desirable and in the national interest to provide for the supervision and regulation of such clearing and settlement systems, including by providing for their resolution while minimizing the exposure of public moneys to loss, in order to control risk to the financial system in Canada and promote its efficiency and stability;

**Directive to participants**

- **(2)** The Governor of the Bank may issue a directive in writing to a participant that requires the participant, within any period that may be specified in the directive, to take any corrective measures that the Governor considers necessary if the Governor has formed an opinion referred to in subsection (1) that systemic risk or payments system risk could be inadequately controlled and
