### Coordination and Application



**Notice**

**20** 

- **(1)** If an Indigenous group, community or people intends to exercise its legislative authority in relation to child and family services, an Indigenous governing body acting on behalf of that Indigenous group, community or people may give notice of that intention to the Minister and the government of each province in which the Indigenous group, community or people is located.

**Coordination agreement**

- **(2)** The Indigenous governing body may also request that the Minister and the government of each of those provinces enter into a coordination agreement with the Indigenous governing body in relation to the exercise of the legislative authority, respecting, among other things,

	- **(d)** any other coordination measure related to the effective exercise of the legislative authority.

**Application — sections 21 and 22**

- **(3)** Sections 21 and 22 apply only in respect of an Indigenous group, community or people on whose behalf an Indigenous governing body

**New request**

- **(6)** If sections 21 and 22 do not apply in respect of an Indigenous group, community or people, nothing prevents the Indigenous governing body that has already made a request under subsection (2) on behalf of the Indigenous group, community or people from making a new request.

**Coordination agreement entered into after one year**

- **(7)** For greater certainty, even if sections 21 and 22 apply in respect of an Indigenous group, community or people on behalf of which an Indigenous governing body has not entered into a coordination agreement, nothing prevents the Indigenous governing body from entering into a coordination agreement after the end of the period referred to in paragraph (3)(b).




**Force of law**

**21**

**Clarification**

- **(2)** The reference to a “federal Act or regulation” in subsection (1) does not include a reference to a law that has the force of law under subsection 21(1).

**Conflict — provincial laws**

- **(3)** For greater certainty, if there is a conflict or inconsistency between a provision respecting child and family services that is in a law of an Indigenous group, community or people and a provision respecting child and family services that is in a provincial Act or regulation, the provision that is in the law of the Indigenous group, community or people prevails to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
