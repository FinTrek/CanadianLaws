**Preamble**

Whereas a fundamental responsibility of the Government of Canada is to protect Canada’s national security and the safety of Canadians;

Whereas that responsibility must be carried out in accordance with the rule of law and in a manner that safeguards the rights and freedoms of Canadians and that respects the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to enhancing Canada’s national security framework in order to keep Canadians safe while safeguarding their rights and freedoms;

Whereas the Government of Canada, by carrying out its national security and information activities in a manner that respects rights and freedoms, encourages the international community to do the same;

Whereas enhanced accountability and transparency are vital to ensuring public trust and confidence in Government of Canada institutions that carry out national security or intelligence activities;

Whereas those institutions must always be vigilant in order to uphold public safety;

Whereas those institutions must have powers that will enable them to keep pace with evolving threats and must use those powers in a manner that respects the rights and freedoms of Canadians;

Whereas many Canadians expressed concerns about provisions of the Anti-terrorism Act, 2015;

And whereas the Government of Canada engaged in comprehensive public consultations to obtain the views of Canadians on how to enhance Canada’s national security framework and committed to introducing legislation to reflect the views and concerns expressed by Canadians;
