**Preamble**

Whereas a fundamental responsibility of the Government of Canada is to protect Canada’s national security and the safety of Canadians;

Whereas Parliament recognizes that information needs to be disclosed, requested or used in order to enable the Government to fulfill that responsibility;

Whereas that responsibility must be fulfilled in accordance with the rule of law and in a manner that safeguards the rights and freedoms of Canadians and that respects the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;

Whereas Canada is a party to a number of international agreements that prohibit torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including the Geneva Conventions, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;

Whereas torture is an offence under the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), which Act also prohibits aiding and abetting the commission of torture, counselling the commission of torture, conspiring to commit torture, attempting to commit torture and being an accessory after the fact to torture;

And whereas torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of individuals are an affront to Canadian values and are opposed by the Government of Canada in the strongest terms;



Now therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
