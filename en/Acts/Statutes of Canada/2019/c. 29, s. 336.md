**Preamble**

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to

achieving reconciliation with First Nations, the Métis and the Inuit through renewed nation-to-nation, government-to-government and Inuit-Crown relationships based on affirmation and implementation of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership,

takes into account socio-economic gaps that persist between Indigenous individuals and other Canadians with respect to a range of matters as well as social factors having an impact on health and well-being,

recognizes and promotes Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing,

collaborates and cooperates with Indigenous peoples and with the provinces and territories, and

implements the gradual transfer of departmental responsibilities to Indigenous organizations;
