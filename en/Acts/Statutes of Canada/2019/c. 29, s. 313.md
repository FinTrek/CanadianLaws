**Preamble**

Whereas housing is essential to the inherent dignity and well-being of the person and to building sustainable and inclusive communities as well as a strong national economy in which the people of Canada can prosper and thrive;

Whereas access to affordable housing contributes to achieving beneficial social, economic, health and environmental outcomes;
