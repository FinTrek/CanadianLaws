**Proof of violation**

**119** In any proceedings under this Act against a person in relation to a violation, it is sufficient proof of the violation to establish that it was committed by an employee or agent or mandatary of the person, whether or not the employee or agent or mandatary is identified or proceeded against in accordance with this Act.

**120**

**Common law principles**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, a violation is not an offence and, accordingly, section 126 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) does not apply in respect of a violation.




**Limitation period or prescription**

#### Recovery of Penalties

#### General



**Admissibility of documents**

**134** In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a document that appears to be a notice issued under subsection 120(1) is presumed to be authentic and is proof of its contents in any proceeding in respect of a violation.




**Publication**

**135** The Regulator may make public the nature of a violation, the name of the person who committed it and the amount of the penalty.




### Polluter Pays Principle



**Purpose**

### Liability



**Recovery of loss, damage, costs, expenses**

**137** 

- **(1)** If an unintended or uncontrolled release from a pipeline of oil, gas or any other commodity occurs, all persons to whose fault or negligence the release is attributable or who are by law responsible for others to whose fault or negligence the release is attributable are jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable for
	- **(a)** all actual loss or damage incurred by any person as a result of the release or as a result of any action or measure taken in relation to the release;
	- **(b)** the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province, any Indigenous governing body or any other person in taking any action or measure in relation to the release; and

**Contribution based on degree of fault**

- **(2)** The persons who are at fault or negligent or who are by law responsible for persons who are at fault or negligent are liable to make contributions to each other or to indemnify each other in the degree to which they are respectively at fault or negligent.

**Vicarious liability**

- **(3)** The company that is authorized under this Act to construct or operate the pipeline from which the release occurred is jointly and severally, or solidarily, liable with any contractor — to whose fault or negligence the release is attributable — that performs work for the company for the actual loss or damage, the costs and expenses and the loss of non-use value, described in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c).

**Absolute liability**

- **(4)** If an unintended or uncontrolled release of oil, gas or any other commodity from a pipeline occurs, the company that is authorized under this Act to construct or operate that pipeline is liable, without proof of fault or negligence, up to the applicable limit of liability that is set out in subsection (5) for the actual loss or damage, the costs and expenses and the loss of non-use value, described in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c).

**Limits of liability**

- **(5)** For the purposes of subsection (4), the limits of liability are,
	- **(a)** in respect of a company that is authorized under this Act to construct or operate one or more pipelines that individually or in the aggregate have the capacity to transport at least 250,000 barrels of oil per day, $1 billion or, if a greater amount is prescribed by the regulations, that amount; and
	- **(b)** in respect of a company that is authorized under this Act to construct or operate any other pipeline, the amount prescribed by the regulations.

**Regulations — limits of liability**

	- **(b)** prescribe an amount for the purposes of paragraph (5)(b) in respect of a company or class of companies.

**Liability under another law — subsection (4)**

- **(7)** If a company is liable under subsection (4) with respect to a release and it is also liable under any other Act, without proof of fault or negligence, for that release, the company is liable up to the greater of the limit of liability referred to in subsection (5) that applies to it and the limit up to which it is liable under the other Act. If the other Act does not set out a limit of liability, the limits referred to in subsection (5) do not apply.

**Costs and expenses not recoverable under [Fisheries Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-14.md)**

- **(8)** The costs and expenses that are recoverable by Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province under this section are not recoverable under subsection 42(1) of the [Fisheries Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-14.md).

**Proceedings — loss of non-use value**

- **(9)** Only Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province may institute proceedings to recover a loss of non-use value described in paragraph (1)(c).

**Claims**

- **(10)** All claims under this section may be sued for and recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada. Claims in favour of persons incurring actual loss or damage described in paragraph (1)(a) are to be distributed pro rata and rank in priority over claims for costs and expenses described in paragraph (1)(b), and the claims for costs and expenses rank in priority over claims to recover a loss of non-use value described in paragraph (1)(c).

**Saving**

- **(11)** Subject to subsections (8) and (9), nothing in this section suspends or limits
	- **(a)** any legal liability or remedy for an act or omission by reason only that the act or omission is an offence under this Act or gives rise to liability under this section;
	- **(b)** any recourse, indemnity or relief available at law to a person who is liable under this section against any other person; or
	- **(c)** the operation of any applicable law or rule of law that is consistent with this section.

- **(12)** Proceedings in respect of claims under this section may be instituted no later than the third anniversary of the day on which the loss, damage or costs and expenses were incurred but in no case after the sixth anniversary of the day on which the release occurred.




### Financial Requirements



**Financial resources**

**138** 

- **(1)** A company that is authorized under this Act to construct or operate a pipeline must maintain the amount of financial resources necessary to pay the amount of the limit of liability referred to in subsection 137(5) that applies to it or, if the Commission specifies a greater amount, that amount.

**Greater amount**

- **(4)** The Commission may, by order, specify an amount for the purposes of subsection (1).

**Loss of non-use value**

- **(5)** When the Commission specifies an amount for the purposes of subsection (1), it is not required to consider any potential loss of non-use value relating to a public resource that is affected by an unintended or uncontrolled release of oil, gas or any other commodity from a pipeline or by any action or measure taken in relation to the release.

**Continuing obligation**

- **(6)** A company that is authorized under this Act to construct or operate a pipeline must maintain the amount of financial resources referred to in subsection (1) and must comply with any order made under subsection (2) and any regulation made under subsection (7) only until it obtains leave from the Commission to abandon the operation of its pipeline.

**Difference**

- **(2)** If a company meets only a portion of its financial requirements by participating in a pooled fund and the amount of funds in the pooled fund to which it has access — in the event that there is an unintended or uncontrolled release of oil, gas or any other commodity from a pipeline that the company is authorized under this Act to construct or operate — is less than the amount of financial resources referred to in subsection 138(1), the company must maintain an amount equal to the difference between those amounts.

**Regulations**

- **(3)** The Governor in Council may, on the Minister’s recommendation, make regulations respecting a pooled fund referred to in subsection (1), including regulations specifying

### Reimbursement by Company



**Reimbursement —  measures taken by government institution**

### Designated Company



**Designation**

**141**

	- **(a)** the Governor in Council considers that the company does not have or is not likely to have the financial resources necessary to pay
		- **(i)** the costs and expenses incurred, or to be incurred, in taking any action or measure in relation to the release, and
		- **(ii)** the compensation that might be awarded for compensable damage caused by the release; or
	- **(b)** the company does not comply with an order of the Commission with respect to any action or measure to be taken in relation to the release.

**Measures to be taken**

- **(2)** If the Governor in Council designates a company under subsection (1), the Regulator or any of its officers or employees — or class of officers or employees — that the Regulator authorizes may take any action or measure that they consider necessary in relation to the release or they may authorize a third party to take any action or measure.

**No liability**

- **(3)** No action lies against the Regulator or an officer or employee of the Regulator or against a servant of the Crown, as those terms are defined in section 2 of the [Crown Liability and Proceedings Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-50.md), in respect of any act or omission committed in taking any action or measure in relation to the release.

**142** 

- **(1)** Subject to the Treasury Board’s approval, the Regulator must, for the purposes of recovering the amounts paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under subsection 171(1), even if those amounts are more than the amount of the limit of liability referred to in subsection 137(5) that applies to a designated company, make regulations
	- **(a)** imposing fees, levies or charges on a designated company and, if the amount recovered from the designated company is not sufficient to recover the amounts paid out, imposing fees, levies or charges on companies that are authorized under this Act to construct or operate pipelines that transport the same commodity or a commodity of the same class as the commodity that was released from a pipeline constructed or operated by the designated company; and
	- **(b)** prescribing the manner of calculating the fees, levies and charges and their payment to the Regulator.

**Interest on late payments**

**Debt due to Her Majesty**

- **(3)** Fees, levies or charges imposed under this section and any interest payable on them constitute a debt that is due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered as such in any court of competent jurisdiction.




### Pipeline Claims Tribunal



#### Establishment



**Establishment of Tribunal**

**143** 

- **(1)** The Governor in Council may, by order, after a designation is made under subsection 141(1), establish a pipeline claims tribunal whose purpose is to examine and adjudicate, as expeditiously as the circumstances and considerations of fairness permit, the claims for compensation made under this Act in relation to the release that occurred from the designated company’s pipeline and specify the location of its head office.

**Reasons**

- **(2)** However, the Governor in Council may establish a pipeline claims tribunal only if, having regard to the extent of the compensable damage caused by the release, the estimated cost of paying compensation in respect of that damage and the advantages of having claims dealt with by an administrative tribunal, the Governor in Council considers it in the public interest to do so.

**Claims treated equitably**

- **(3)** A Tribunal must exercise its powers and perform its duties and functions with respect to claims for compensation in an equitable manner, without discrimination on the basis of nationality or residence.




**Jurisdiction of courts**

**144** For greater certainty, nothing in sections 143 and 145 to 173 is to be construed as restricting the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the release referred to in subsection 143(1).




**Public notice**

**145** Immediately after a Tribunal is established, the Regulator must notify the public, in a manner that the Tribunal considers appropriate, of the Tribunal’s purpose and the manner in which to obtain information on making a claim for compensation and must publish in the Canada Gazette a notice setting out that purpose and the manner in which to obtain that information.




**Members of Tribunal**

**146**

**Members’ qualifications**

- **(2)** The members of the Tribunal are to be appointed from among persons who are retired judges of a superior court or members of at least 10 years standing at either the bar of a province or the *Chambre des notaires du Québec*.

**Replacing member**

- **(3)** If a member is absent or becomes incapacitated, resigns or dies, the Governor in Council may appoint a replacement for that member.

**Remuneration**

- **(4)** The Regulator must pay the members the remuneration and expenses that are fixed by the Governor in Council.




**Tenure**

**147** 

- **(1)** Each member of a Tribunal is to hold office during good behaviour, but may be removed by the Governor in Council for cause.

**Termination of Tribunal**

- **(2)** The Governor in Council may terminate the appointment of the members of the Tribunal if the Governor in Council is satisfied that the Tribunal has no work to carry out.




**Immunity**

**148** No action lies against any member of a Tribunal for anything done or omitted to be done by the member in the exercise or purported exercise of a power or in the performance or purported performance of a duty or function of the Tribunal.




#### Chairperson and Staff



**Chairperson**

**149** 

- **(1)** The Governor in Council must, on the Minister’s recommendation, designate one of the members of a Tribunal to be the Chairperson of the Tribunal.

**Chairperson’s powers, duties and functions**

- **(2)** The Chairperson apportions work among the members of the Tribunal and, if he or she establishes a panel, assigns members to the panel and designates a member to preside over it. The Chairperson also has supervision over and direction of the work of the Tribunal’s staff.




**Staff**

**150** A Tribunal may employ the staff that it considers necessary for the proper exercise of its powers and performance of its duties and functions, prescribe their duties and, subject to any regulations, the conditions of their employment and, with the Treasury Board’s approval, fix their remuneration.




**Technical or specialized knowledge**

**151** A Tribunal may engage, on a temporary basis, the services of counsel or notaries and other persons having technical or specialized knowledge to assist it in its work, prescribe their duties and the conditions of their employment and, with the Treasury Board’s approval, fix their remuneration and expenses.




**Payment by Regulator**

- **(2)** When deciding whether to make an order, give a direction or grant a leave, approval or exemption in respect of a pipeline that passes in, on, over, under, through or across a navigable water, the Commission must take into account the effects that its decision might have on navigation, including on the safety of navigation, in addition to any other factor that it considers appropriate.




**Pipeline not work**

**220** Despite the definition work in section 2 of the [Canadian Navigable Waters Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/N/N-22.md), a pipeline is not a work to which that Act applies.

**Construction without leave**

- **(2)** If, at any time before July 3, 2013, the Minister of Transport or the National Energy Board had provided, under section 108 of the [National Energy Board Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/N/N-7.md), that leave under that section was not necessary because the pipeline was to be constructed in accordance with certain orders, regulations, plans and specifications, a company must not construct the pipeline other than in accordance with those orders, regulations, plans and specifications or as specified by the Commission.




**Offence and punishment**

	- **(a)** that section or part of the pipeline remains subject to the rights of the company and remains the property of the company as fully as it was before being affixed and does not become part of the real property or immovable of any person other than the company unless otherwise agreed by the company in writing and unless notice of the agreement in writing has been filed with the Regulator; and
	- **(b)** subject to the other provisions of this Act, the company may create a lien, mortgage, charge or other security, or the company may constitute a hypothec, on that section or part of the pipeline.

### Traffic, Tolls and Tariffs



#### Interpretation



**Definition of tariff**

**225** In sections 226 to 240, ***tariff*** means a schedule of tolls, conditions, classifications, practices or rules and regulations applicable to the provision of a service by a company, and includes rules respecting the calculation of tolls.




#### Commission’s Powers



**Orders**

**226** The Commission may make orders with respect to all matters relating to traffic, tolls or tariffs.




#### Filing of Tariff



**Tariff to be filed**

**227** A company must file each tariff it makes and any amendments made to a tariff, with the Regulator.




**Commencement of tariff**

**228** If a company files a tariff with the Regulator and the company proposes to charge a toll referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition toll in section 2, the Commission may establish the day on which the tariff is to come into effect, and the company is prohibited from charging the toll before that day.




**Authorized tolls**

**229** 

- **(1)** A company is prohibited from charging a toll unless the toll is
	- **(a)** specified in a tariff that is filed with the Regulator and is in effect; or
	- **(b)** approved by an order of the Commission.

**Deemed tariff**

- **(2)** If the oil, gas or other commodity transmitted by a company through its pipeline is the property of the company, the company must, if requested by the Regulator, file copies of any contract it enters into for the sale of the oil, gas or commodity, or any amendments it makes to such a contract, with the Regulator and those copies are deemed, for the purpose of sections 225 to 240, to be a tariff filed in accordance with subsection (1).




#### Just and Reasonable Tolls



**Tolls**

**230** All tolls must be just and reasonable, and must always, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions with respect to all traffic of the same description carried over the same route, be charged equally to all persons at the same rate.




**Determination — Commission**

**231** The Commission may determine
- **(a)** whether traffic is or has been carried under substantially similar circumstances and conditions for the purposes of section 230;
- **(b)** whether a company has complied with the provisions of section 230; and
- **(c)** whether there has been unjust discrimination for the purposes of section 235.




**Interim tolls**

**232** If the Commission has made an interim order authorizing a company to charge tolls until a specified time or the happening of a specified event, the Commission may, in any subsequent order, direct the company
- **(a)** to refund, in the manner that the Commission considers appropriate, the part of the tolls charged under the interim order that is in excess of the tolls determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable, together with interest on the amount to be refunded; or
- **(b)** to recover in its tolls, in the manner that the Commission considers appropriate, the amount by which the tolls determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable exceed the tolls charged under the interim order, together with interest on the amount to be recovered.




#### Disallowance or Suspension of Tariff



**Disallowance**

**233** The Commission may disallow any tariff or any portion of a tariff that it considers to be contrary to this Act or to any order of the Commission, and may require a company to substitute in its place, within a prescribed time, a tariff that the Commission considers satisfactory, or may prescribe other tariffs in place of the tariff or the portion of the tariff that is disallowed.




**Suspension**

**234** The Commission may suspend the application of any tariff or any portion of a tariff before or after the tariff goes into effect.




#### Discrimination



**No unjust discrimination**

**235** A company must not make any unjust discrimination in tolls, service or facilities against any person or locality.




**Burden of proof**

**236** If it is shown that a company makes any discrimination in tolls, service or facilities against any person or locality, the burden of proving that the discrimination is not unjust lies on the company.




**Prohibition**

**237** 

- **(1)** A company or shipper, or an officer, employee or agent or mandatary of a company or shipper, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction if they
	- **(a)** offer, grant, give, solicit, accept or receive a rebate, concession or discrimination that allows a person to obtain transmission of hydrocarbons or any other commodity by a company at a rate less than that named in the tariffs then in effect; or

#### Contracts Limiting Liabilities



**General rule**

**238** 

- **(1)** Except as provided in this section, no contract, condition or notice made or given by a company limiting its liability in respect of the transmission of hydrocarbons or any other commodity relieves the company from its liability, unless that class of contract, condition or notice is included as a condition of its tariffs that are filed with the Regulator or has been first approved by order of the Commission or authorized by regulation.

**Commission’s orders**

- **(2)** The Commission may, by order, on any conditions that it specifies in the order, require a company operating a pipeline for the transmission of gas or a commodity other than oil to, according to its powers, receive, transport and deliver such a commodity offered for transmission by means of its pipeline.

**Extension of facilities**

- **(3)** If the Commission considers it necessary or in the public interest and it finds that no undue burden will be placed on the company, it may require a company operating a pipeline for the transmission of oil, gas or any other commodity to provide adequate and suitable facilities for
	- **(a)** receiving, transmitting and delivering the oil, gas or other commodity offered for transmission by means of its pipeline;
	- **(b)** storing the oil, gas or other commodity; and
	- **(c)** joining its pipeline with other facilities for the transmission of oil, gas or any other commodity.




#### Transmission and Sale of Gas



**Extension or improvement**

**240** 

- **(1)** If the Commission considers it necessary or in the public interest and it finds that no undue burden will be placed on the company, it may direct a company operating a pipeline for the transmission of gas to extend or improve its facilities to facilitate joining its pipeline with the facilities of, and sell gas to, any person or municipality engaged or legally authorized to engage in the local distribution of gas to the public, and for those purposes to construct branch lines to communities immediately adjacent to its pipeline.

**Limitation**

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not empower the Commission to compel a company to sell gas to additional customers if to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its existing customers.

**Deemed toll**

- **(3)** If the gas transmitted by a company through its pipeline is the property of the company, the differential between the cost to the company of the gas at the point where it enters its pipeline and the amount for which the gas is sold by the company is, for the purposes of sections 225 to 240, deemed to be a toll charged by the company to the purchaser for the transmission of that gas.

**Public hearing**

- **(3)** If a written statement of opposition to the abandonment is filed with the Regulator or if a person requests in writing that a hearing be held in respect of the application for leave to abandon the operation of a pipeline, the Commission must order that a public hearing be conducted in respect of the application unless
	- **(a)** the person who filed the written statement or who requested the hearing files a notice of withdrawal with the Regulator; or
