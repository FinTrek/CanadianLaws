Whereas autism spectrum disorders affect a significant number of families in Canada;

Whereas Canada has a health care system and social safety net to prevent illness and serve citizens;

Whereas Canadian families affected by autism spectrum disorders have unequal access to services across the country;

Whereas worldwide the number of diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders is growing;

Whereas a greater awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for people with autism is required to engage more Canadians in helping their fellow citizens;

Whereas early intervention in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders can have promising results and help people engage with and contribute to society;

Whereas there is no known cause or cure for autism spectrum disorders;

Whereas Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which maintain that children with disabilities should enjoy a full and decent life in conditions that ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate their active participation in the community, while also enjoying all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children;

And whereas Canada is a member of the United Nations and supports the work of this vital international organization;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
