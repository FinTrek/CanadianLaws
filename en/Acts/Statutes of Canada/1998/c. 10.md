**No appropriation**

**25** No payment to a port authority or a wholly-owned subsidiary of a port authority may be made under an appropriation by Parliament to enable the port authority or subsidiary to discharge an obligation or liability. This section applies

In that case, the provision applies to the subsidiary as if it were a port authority, with such modifications as the circumstances require.

**Existing activities**

- **(13)** A wholly-owned subsidiary of a port authority may continue to carry on any activity or exercise any power that it carried on or exercised on December 1, 1995 but, if the subsidiary ceases to carry on the activity or exercise the power at any time, it may not recommence it unless the activity or power is authorized in the letters patent.
