	- **(a)** if at least one of the profiles is contained in the victims index, the investigation of a designated offence with respect to which that profile was obtained; and
	- **(b)** in any other case, the investigation of any designated offence.

**Missing persons and human remains indices**

- **(2)** If a comparison conducted under subsection 5.5(1) produces a match between DNA profiles, and at least one of the profiles that match is contained in the missing persons index or the human remains index, the Commissioner may communicate any information in relation to the profiles, to any investigating authority that the Commissioner considers appropriate, for the purpose of the investigation of a missing person or human remains.

**Communication — similar profile**

**6.1** 

- **(1)** If a comparison conducted under subsection 5.5(1) indicates that, in the Commissioner’s opinion, two or more DNA profiles are similar, the Commissioner may communicate the similar DNA profiles, to any investigating authority that the Commissioner considers appropriate, for the purpose of determining whether the possibility of a match between the profiles can be excluded.

**Deemed match**

- **(2)** If the investigating authority advises the Commissioner that the profiles are similar and that the possibility of a match between the DNA profiles has not been excluded, the Commissioner may communicate any information in relation to the profiles in accordance with subsection 6(1) or (2), as the case may be, as if there were a match between them.

**Relatives of missing persons index**

- **(3)** If a comparison conducted under subsection 5.5(2) indicates that a DNA profile that is already contained in the missing persons index or human remains index could be the profile of a biological relative of someone whose DNA profile is added to the relatives of missing persons index, the Commissioner may communicate any information in relation to both DNA profiles, to any investigating authority that the Commissioner considers appropriate, for the purpose of the investigation of a missing person or human remains.
> 2014, c. 39, s. 238.





**Communication — no match**

### Removal of Access to Information



**Removal of access to information — crime scene index**

	- **(b)** a person who has been eliminated as a suspect in the relevant investigation.

**Other indices**

- **(2)** Access to information in relation to a DNA profile in the victims index, the missing persons index, the relatives of missing persons index, the human remains index or the voluntary donors index shall be removed from that index without delay if the Commissioner is advised that
	- **(a)** the person from whose bodily substances the profile was derived wishes to have access to the information removed; or
	- **(b)** the comparison under this Act of the profile with other profiles will not assist in the investigation with respect to which the profile was obtained.

**Periodic removal**

- **(3)** After each period prescribed by regulation, access to information in relation to a DNA profile in the victims index, the missing persons index, the relatives of missing persons index or the voluntary donors index shall be removed from that index without delay unless the Commissioner is advised before the end of the period, by any investigating authority that the Commissioner considers appropriate, that
	- **(a)** the investigating authority has not been advised by the person from whose bodily substances the profile was derived that they wish to have access to the information removed; and
	- **(b)** the comparison under this Act of the profile with other profiles may assist in the investigation with respect to which the profile was obtained.

**Subsequent DNA profile**

- **(4)** Removal of access to information in relation to a DNA profile of a person from an index under this section does not prevent a DNA profile derived from the bodily substances of the same person, and any information in relation to that profile, from subsequently being added to any index in accordance with this Act.

**Regulations — requirements**

- **(5)** The removal of access to information under any of subsections (1) to (3) shall be done in accordance with the requirements set out in any regulations that apply with respect to that subsection.

**Change in technology**

**Mandatory destruction in certain cases**

- **(7)** The Commissioner shall destroy the stored bodily substances of a person
	- **(a)** without delay after every order or authorization for the collection of bodily substances from the person is finally set aside; or
	- **(b)** without delay after the person is finally acquitted of every designated offence in connection with which an order was made or an authorization was granted.
	- **(c)** [Repealed, 2014, c. 39, s. 243]

**When record suspension is in effect**

- **(8)** Despite anything in this section, stored bodily substances of a person in respect of whom a record suspension, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the [Criminal Records Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-47.md), is in effect shall be kept separate and apart from other stored bodily substances, and no such bodily substance shall be used for forensic DNA analysis, nor shall the existence of such a bodily substance be communicated to any person.
