**7** NATURAL GAS NET PROFIT FORMULA

**(1)** For the purposes of this Agreement, the amount of Net Profit derived by the Province, including agencies of the Province, from the disposition of Natural Gas underlying the Reserve shall be determined separately in respect of each Production Month, in accordance with the steps set forth in this paragraph 7, but for the purposes of making the calculations under each of the steps it is agreed that whenever Subject Gas is intermingled with Other Gas (that is, Natural Gas which is not Subject Gas) the Subject Gas shall for all such purposes be deemed to be apportioned among each of the Domestic Utilities and the Foreign Utility in the same proportions as deemed for the purposes of calculating the volume of British Columbia-produced gas sold and delivered under Licence GL-41, (as amended from time to time) issued by the National Energy Board (herein called the “NEB”) and for the settling of accounts between Westcoast and the Petroleum Corporation pursuant to either the Basic Agreement as amended from time to time or the directions of the NEB.

*Step One*

Determine the Domestic Price (“DP”) for the Production Month which is the subject of the calculation (the Production Month which is the subject of the calculation being referred to herein as the “Subject Month”) by use of Alternative One hereunder until the date of execution of this Agreement, and thereafter by use of whichever of Alternative One and Alternative Two will produce the greater Domestic Price in the Subject Month.

*Alternative One*

By use of the formula
```
DP = P/V
```
where
- **P** = The total amount of money payable by the Domestic Utilities to Westcoast for the Sales Volume (that is, the volume of Natural Gas produced in British Columbia and purchased by the Domestic Utilities during the Subject Month);
- **V** = The Sales Volume expressed in Mcf.





*Alternative Two*

By the use of the formula
```
DP = CS+CG+1¢ (one cent);
```
where
- **CS and CG** have the meanings assigned to them in Step Three of this paragraph 7.









*Step Two*

Calculate the Average Price (“AP”) by use of the formula
```
AP = (DP×a) + (EP×b)
```
where
- **DP** = Domestic Price determined according to Step One;
- **a** = Domestic Sales (that is, the volume of Natural Gas sold and delivered to the Domestic Utilities) during the Subject Month, stated as a percentage of Total Sales (defined below) for that month;
- **b** = Export Sales (that is, the volume of Natural Gas produced in British Columbia and delivered to the US-Canada boundary pursuant to NEB Licence GL-41, as amended from time to time) for the Subject Month, stated as a percentage of Total Sales;
- **EP** = The total amount payable to Westcoast by Northwest Pipeline Corporation, the successors to or assigns of the right to purchase gas under NEB Licence GL-41 for the Export Sales made during the Subject Month divided by the volume of such sales expressed in Mcf.





***Total Sales***, where used in the paragraph 7, means the total of Domestic Sales and Export Sales for the Subject Month expressed in Mcf.



*Step Three*

Calculate Net Profit (“NP”) by use of the formula
```
NP = (GP-Sh) × (AP-(CS+CG))
```
where
- **GP** = the number of Mcf of Residue Gas derived from Subject Gas produced during the Subject Month;
- **Sh** = the number of Mcf which is that percentage of GP which Shrinkage during the Subject Month is of the Residue Gas Supply for that month;
- **AP** = Average Price calculated as aforesaid in respect of the Subject Month;
- **CS** = the total of the following:
- **(i)** all sums which Westcoast is entitled (either by virtue of the Basic Agreement as amended from time to time or the orders of the National Energy Board) to recover from the Petroleum Corporation in respect of the handling (including gathering, processing and transmission) of Natural Gas during the Subject Month,
- **(ii)** all costs (other than those referred to in either clause (i) of this definition of CS or in the definition of CG) incurred by the Petroleum Corporation in the course of its operations during the Subject Month,expressed in an amount per Mcf of Total Sales as defined in Step Two, during the Subject Month;
- **CG** = the amount of money paid or payable by the Petroleum Corporation for the purchase during the Subject Month of Subject Gas, expressed as an amount per Mcf of Subject Gas sold and delivered during the Subject Month (that is, GP-Sh); which amount shall include the holdback, if any, made by the Petroleum Corporation (on the purchase of Old Gas) in accordance with the provisions of the gas purchase contracts dealing with Old Gas Credits as therein defined.







**(2)** That portion of the Net Profit derived in respect of a given Production Month which is payable to Canada as aforesaid shall be paid by the Province to Canada within ninety (90) days after the end of such month.



**(3)** If a Pool lies partly under the Reserve and partly under other lands, the proportion of the amount of Natural Gas produced during a Production Month from that Pool which is attributable to lands included within the Reserve shall be deemed to be equal to the proportion which the recoverable reserves of Natural Gas contained in that part of the Pool underlying the Reserve bears to the total amount of recoverable reserves of Natural Gas in the Pool.



**(4)** It is agreed that 7.44% of the total amount of Natural Gas in the Clarke Lake Field based upon the present Zero Line shall be deemed to be the Band’s share thereof.



**(5)** If in the future it is determined that the actual boundaries of the Natural Gas Pool defined herein as the Clarke Lake Field extend beyond the lands described in Schedule “C”, the agreed percentage set out in subparagraph (4) of paragraph 7 hereof shall be adjusted accordingly between the parties, and, failing agreement, shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to paragraph 12 hereof.





**8** BOOKS AND RECORDS

**(1)** Whenever any moneys are paid hereunder by the Province to Canada they will be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which such moneys were calculated.



**(2)** The Province and its agents will keep proper books and records of the calculation and the receipt of revenues and profits pursuant to this Agreement, and will make such books and records available to audit and inspection by Canada or its agent, and will allow Canada or its agent to make copies thereof and take extracts therefrom, and will furnish Canada or its agent with such additional information relevant to the calculation and receipt of revenues and profits hereunder as Canada or its agent may reasonably require.





**9** PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS — ENTRY AND ARBITRATION

**(1)** The administration and control of the surface of the Reserve remains in Canada for the use and benefit of the Band.



**(2)** Subject to subparagraph (6) hereof, any agreement in force at the date of execution of this Agreement whereby Canada granted rights of entry to the Reserve for the purpose of Petroleum or Natural Gas exploration, development or production, or any other purpose, shall remain in effect as though this Agreement had not been executed.
