**Purpose**

## Database



**Establishment**

**4**

- **(2)** The Commissioner’s duties under this Act may be performed on behalf of the Commissioner by any person who is authorized by the Commissioner to perform those duties.

**Prior notification**

**6** The Commissioner must, before including the given name and surname of a person referred to in subsection 4(1) in the database, take reasonable steps to notify that person that information with respect to them is to be included in the database and allow that person to make representations concerning the matter.




**Removal of information**

**7** 

- **(1)** On the receipt of an application in writing by a person referred to in subsection 4(1), the Commissioner must decide whether there are reasonable grounds to remove information with respect to that person from the database.

**Deeming**

- **(2)** If the Commissioner does not make a decision on the application within the period prescribed by regulation, the Commissioner is deemed to have decided not to remove the information in question.

**Notice of decision to applicant**

- **(3)** The Commissioner must give notice without delay to the applicant of any decision made or deemed to have been made respecting the application.

**Judicial review**

- **(4)** Within 60 days after receipt of the notice of the decision, the applicant may apply to the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision.




**Regular review of information**

**8** Within the period prescribed by regulation after the establishment of the database, and at prescribed intervals after that, the Commissioner must review the information in the database to determine whether the information should still be maintained in the database. The review does not affect the validity of the database.




**Non-derogation**

**9** Nothing in this Act affects any authority of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police under another Act of Parliament or an Act of a provincial legislature or at common law to disclose information.




**Immunity**
