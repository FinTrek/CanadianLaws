**Preamble**

Whereas the art of fiddle playing has a significant role in the cultural and social history of Canada and is practised in all of the regions of Canada;

Whereas newcomers to Canada and their Canadian descendants have enriched the culture and the different styles and repertoires of fiddle music during many generations;

Whereas in 2012 an international campaign began among fiddle players to encourage popular recognition and acclaim of a World Fiddle Day on the third Saturday in May each year, to celebrate the appreciation, beauty and history of fiddle music, and in honour of Antonio Stradivari, the renowned crafter of stringed instruments;

And whereas it is in the interest of all Canadians to become more familiar with the traditional and contemporary importance of fiddling and its importance to Canadian heritage and Canadian society;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






## Short Title
