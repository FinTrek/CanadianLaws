- **(1)** If a passport has been cancelled as a result of a decision of the Minister under the [Canadian Passport Order](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Instruments/81/86.md) that the passport is to be cancelled on the grounds that the cancellation is necessary to prevent the commission of a terrorism offence, as defined in section 2 of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md), or for the national security of Canada or a foreign country or state, the person to whom the passport was issued may appeal that decision to a judge within 30 days after the day on which the person receives notice of the Minister’s decision in respect of an application that was made under that Order to have the cancellation reconsidered.

**Extension**

	- **(a)** at any time during the proceeding, the judge must, on the Minister’s request, hear evidence or other information in the absence of the public and of the appellant and their counsel if, in the judge’s opinion, the disclosure of the evidence or other information could be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person;
	- **(b)** the judge must ensure the confidentiality of the evidence and other information provided by the Minister if, in the judge’s opinion, its disclosure would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person;
	- **(c)** throughout the proceeding, the judge must ensure that the appellant is provided with a summary of evidence and other information that enables the appellant to be reasonably informed of the Minister’s case but that does not include anything that, in the judge’s opinion, would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of any person if disclosed;
	- **(d)** the judge must provide the appellant and the Minister with an opportunity to be heard;
