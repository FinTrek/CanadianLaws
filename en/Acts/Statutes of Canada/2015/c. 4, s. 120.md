**Foreign operator’s obligation — transporting nuclear material within Canada**

- **(2)** The Minister may require an operator, as defined in Article 1.I(d) of the Annex to the Convention but who is not an operator as defined in section 2 of this Act, and who is transporting nuclear material within Canada to maintain financial security in an amount prescribed by regulation but not more than the amount referred to in subsection 24(1) to compensate persons who suffer damage that is caused by a nuclear incident.

**Non-application**

**Indemnity agreements — operator subject to regulation made under paragraph 24(2)(b)**

- **(2)** If the nuclear damage is caused by an operator who is subject to a regulation made under paragraph 24(2)(b) and that damage exceeds that operator’s liability under that regulation, the indemnity agreement may also provide that Her Majesty in right of Canada must cover that operator for the difference between the operator’s liability under the regulation and the liability of any other operator under subsection 24(1).

	- **(b)** charged all amounts that are payable by Her Majesty in right of Canada under an indemnity agreement.

**Advances to account out of C.R.F.**

- **(2)** If the amount standing to the credit of the Nuclear Liability Account is insufficient for the payment of the amounts that are required under the terms of an indemnity agreement, an amount that is sufficient to meet the deficit is, with the Minister of Finance’s approval, to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and credited to the Nuclear Liability Account.
