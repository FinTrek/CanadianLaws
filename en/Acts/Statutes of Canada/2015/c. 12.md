----------




**Preamble**

Whereas Canadians and small businesses have expressed concerns about how the increased administrative burden imposed by regulations has affected the cost of doing business;

Whereas on April 1, 2012 the Government of Canada established a rule that each increase in the administrative burden on businesses must be offset with a corresponding decrease, one-for-one, and considers that it is desirable to establish that rule in legislation;

Whereas the one-for-one rule must not compromise public health, public safety or the Canadian economy;

And whereas the Government of Canada recognizes the importance of being transparent with regard to the implementation of the one-for-one rule;



Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
