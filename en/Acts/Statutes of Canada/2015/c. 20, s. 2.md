# Security of Canada Information Disclosure Act

**S.C. 2015, c. 20, s. 2**


Assented to on 18 June 2015

```
[Enacted by section 2 of chapter 20 of the Statutes of Canada, 2015, in force August 1, 2015, see SI/2015-64.]
```
----------




**Preamble**

Whereas the people of Canada are entitled to live free from threats to their lives and their security;

Whereas activities that undermine the security of Canada are often carried out in a clandestine, deceptive or hostile manner, are increasingly global, complex and sophisticated, and often emerge and evolve rapidly;

Whereas there is no more fundamental role for a government than protecting its country and its people;

Whereas Canada is not to be used as a conduit for the carrying out of activities that threaten the security of another state;

Whereas protecting Canada and its people against activities that undermine the security of Canada often transcends the mandate and capability of any one Government of Canada institution;

Whereas Parliament recognizes that information needs to be disclosed — and disparate information needs to be collated — in order to enable the Government to protect Canada and its people against activities that undermine the security of Canada;

Whereas Government of Canada institutions are accountable for the effective and responsible disclosure of information in a manner that respects the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the [Privacy Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-21.md) and other laws regarding the protection of privacy;

And whereas an explicit authority will facilitate the effective and responsible disclosure of information to protect the security of Canada;


> 2015, c. 20, s. 2 “Preamble”2019, c. 13, s. 113

> 2015, c. 20, s. 2 “4”2019, c. 13, s. 117





## Disclosure of Information



**Disclosure of information to institution listed in Schedule 3**

**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to any provision of any other Act of Parliament, or of any regulation made under such an Act, that prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information, a Government of Canada institution may, on its own initiative or on request, disclose information to the head of a recipient Government of Canada institution whose title is listed in Schedule 3, or to a person designated by the head of that recipient institution, if the disclosing institution is satisfied that
	- **(a)** the disclosure will contribute to the exercise of the recipient institution’s jurisdiction, or the carrying out of its responsibilities, under an Act of Parliament or another lawful authority, in respect of activities that undermine the security of Canada; and
	- **(b)** the disclosure will not affect any person’s privacy interest more than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.

**Statement regarding accuracy and reliability**

- **(2)** An institution that discloses information under subsection (1) must, at the time of the disclosure, also provide information regarding its accuracy and the reliability of the manner in which it was obtained.
> 2015, c. 20, s. 2 “5”2019, c. 13, s. 118





**Requirement to destroy or return**

**Exception**

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply if the retention of the information is required by law.

**[Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-23.md)**

- **(3)** Subsection (1) does not apply to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in respect of any information that relates to the performance of its duties and functions under section 12 of the [Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-23.md).
> 2019, c. 13, s. 118

**6** Nothing in section 5 or 5.1 is to be construed as authorizing the collection or use of any information that is disclosed under section 5.
> 2015, c. 20, s. 2 “6”2019, c. 13, s. 118





**No presumption**

**7** The act of disclosing information under this Act does not create a presumption
- **(a)** that the disclosing institution is conducting a joint investigation or decision-making process with the recipient institution and therefore has the same obligations, if any, as the recipient institution to disclose or produce information for the purposes of a proceeding; or
- **(b)** that there has been a waiver of any privilege, or of any requirement to obtain consent, for the purposes of any other disclosure of that information either in a proceeding or to an institution that is not a Government of Canada institution.




**Clarification**

**7.1** For greater certainty, for the purpose of paragraph 8(2)(b) of the [Privacy Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-21.md), the authority in this Act to disclose information includes the authority to disclose personal information, as defined in section 3 of the [Privacy Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-21.md).
> 2019, c. 13, s. 118.1
