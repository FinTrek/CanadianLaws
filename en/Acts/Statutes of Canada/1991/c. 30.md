- **(a)** by such amounts as the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, may authorize, in the case of a compensation plan contained in

		- **(ii)** the terms and conditions of the plan, collective agreement or arbitral award, other than wage rates, in effect on the day on which the plan, collective agreement or arbitral award would, but for this subsection, expire, shall continue in force without change for the forty-eight month period immediately following that day.
