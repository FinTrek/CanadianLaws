	- **(c)** the common shares without par value of the capital stock of IAC Limited shall be deemed to have a par value of twenty dollars or such other amount as the Minister of Finance may require.

**By-laws of IAC Limited**

- **(3)** By-laws of IAC Limited affecting the interpretation or application of the provisions of the [Bank Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2046.md) made applicable to IAC Limited and its shares by subsection (1) are properly made if made in accordance with sections 17 and 27 of the [Bank Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2046.md).

**Investment Companies Act**

- **(4)** To the extent that the requirements of sections 11 to 13 of the Investment Companies Act differ from those of sections 53 to 56 of the [Bank Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2046.md), those sections of the Investment Companies Act do not apply to IAC Limited or to its shares but IAC Limited shall be considered for purposes of all other sections of the Investment Companies Act to be a sales finance company to or in respect of which sections 11 to 13 of the Act apply.




**Issue of shares**

**13** IAC Limited shall not issue any additional shares of its capital stock unless
- **(a)** concurrently with the receipt by IAC Limited of the proceeds of the issue of shares, it applies an amount equal to the net cash proceeds to the purchase of shares in the capital stock of the Bank or as a contribution to the rest account of the Bank, or allocates that amount between the two applications; and

**Securities of IAC Limited**

**15** 

- **(1)** Neither the preferred shares of IAC Limited outstanding on October 28, 1975, nor the debentures of IAC Limited outstanding on that date and carrying a right of conversion into common shares of IAC Limited, shall be considered to have been issued or to be outstanding in contravention of the [Bank Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2046.md) or of this Act, and shares of IAC Limited may be validly issued upon the exercise of such conversion rights notwithstanding anything contained in the [Bank Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2046.md) or this Act, except that shares of IAC Limited may not be so issued to a person from whom a subscription for a share could not, by reason of paragraph 53(4)(a) or (b) or subsection 56(2) of the [Bank Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2046.md), be accepted by IAC Limited.
