----------




**Preamble**

WHEREAS it is desirable in the public interest of Canada to acquire and preserve the great historic battlefields at Quebec, restoring so far as possible their principal features, so as to make them a Canadian National Park;

Whereas considerable portions of these grounds are already vested in His Majesty for the military or other public purposes of Canada;

Whereas it is anticipated that, in addition to the appropriation of public moneys of Canada hereby authorized, the various provincial governments, as well as municipal or other bodies, and many private individuals, will contribute generously to the aforesaid project;

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the constitution of a commission for the acquisition, management and control, subject to the provisions of this Act, of the said battlefields and the moneys contributed for the said purposes;



Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:






**Constitution of Commission**

**1** 

- **(1)** The Governor in Council may appoint seven Commissioners, who shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor in Council, and who, with any additional Commissioners who may be appointed under the authority of this Act, shall be a body politic and corporate under the name of “The National Battlefields Commission”.

**Commissioners appointed by provincial governments**

- **(2)** The Government of any province which contributes a sum not less than one hundred thousand dollars to the purposes of the commission shall be entitled to appoint a commissioner, and such commissioner shall hold office during the pleasure of the Government of the province.

**Plan and description**

- **(2)** A plan and description purporting to be signed by the chairman and secretary of the commission shall have the same effect for the purposes of this Act as a plan and description signed by the Minister or deputy minister has under The Expropriation Act; and for all purposes of the proceedings authorized by this Act the provisions of The Expropriation Act shall, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context, be construed with the substitution of the commission for His Majesty, for the Crown and for the Minister.

**Information in Federal Court Proviso as to damages**

- **(3)** In any case in which land or property is acquired, taken or injuriously affected under the authority of this Act, the Attorney General of Canada may cause an information in the name of His Majesty, upon the relation of the commission, to be exhibited in the Federal Court of Canada, and the provisions of The Expropriation Act shall, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context, apply to such information and the proceedings thereunder in the same manner, *mutatis mutandis*, as they apply to the like informations and proceedings on behalf of His Majesty under the said Act: Provided that His Majesty shall not in any case be liable for any compensation, damages, costs or charges incurred in such proceedings, but the relators shall be subject to the payment of such compensation, damages, costs or charges as may be adjudged by the court.
