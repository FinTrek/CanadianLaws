### Action for Infringement



**Action for infringement**

**8** 

- **(1)** An action for infringement of the exclusive right in a registered topography may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by the owner of the registered topography or by a licensee of any right therein, subject to any agreement between the licensee and the owner.

- **(2)** Each owner of a registered topography shall be or be made a party to any action for infringement of the exclusive right therein.




**Power of court to grant relief**

**9** In an action for infringement of the exclusive right in a registered topography, a court of competent jurisdiction may make such orders as the circumstances require, including orders providing for relief by way of injunction, the payment of royalties and the recovery of damages or profits, for punitive damages, and for the disposal of any infringing integrated circuit product or any article of which an infringing integrated circuit product forms a part.




**Innocent infringement**

**10** Where the exclusive right in a registered topography is infringed by reason of the commercial exploitation or importation of an integrated circuit product that incorporates the registered topography or a substantial part thereof and the defendant in an action for infringement establishes that, at the time the defendant acquired the integrated circuit product, the defendant did not know and had no reasonable grounds to believe that the integrated circuit product was manufactured and sold for the first time without the consent of the owner of the registered topography, the defendant
- **(a)** is not liable for royalties, damages, profits or punitive damages in respect of any dealings with the integrated circuit product prior to the time when the defendant had actual knowledge that the product was manufactured and sold for the first time without the consent of the owner; and
- **(b)** shall have the right to dispose of any inventory of the integrated circuit product or of the article of which the integrated circuit product forms a part that was acquired before the defendant had that knowledge, subject to the condition that the defendant pay a reasonable royalty in respect of that inventory in such amount and at such time as the court may determine.




**Infringement after commercial exploitation in Canada**

**11** 

- **(1)** Where an integrated circuit product that incorporates a registered topography or a substantial part thereof is commercially exploited in Canada by or with the consent of the owner of the registered topography and an action for infringement is commenced in respect of an act of infringement committed after that commercial exploitation, the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief under section 9 other than by way of an injunction if the defendant establishes that, at the time of the infringement, the defendant was not aware and had no reasonable grounds to suspect that the topography was registered.

**Exception**

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply if the plaintiff establishes that all or substantially all of the integrated circuit products that were commercially exploited in Canada by or with the consent of the owner of the registered topography before the infringement, or all or substantially all of the containers housing those integrated circuit products, were visibly marked with a title of the topography that is substantially the same as a title thereof that, at the time of the infringement, appeared on the register.




**Limitation period**

**12** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), no royalties, damages, profits or punitive damages may be awarded for any act of infringement committed more than three years before the commencement of the action for infringement.

**Exception**

- **(2)** The limitation period described in subsection (1) does not apply if
	- **(a)** the infringement is of such a nature that, at the time of its commission, it would not have come to the attention of a reasonably diligent owner or licensee of any right in the registered topography; and
	- **(b)** the action for infringement is commenced within three years after the infringement came or should have come to the attention of the plaintiff.




**Changes in register not applicable**

**13** If any person has relied to the detriment of that person on any entry in the register as it read before being expunged or amended pursuant to this Act or any other Act of Parliament, a court of competent jurisdiction may order that the expungement or amendment not apply in any action for infringement of the exclusive right in a registered topography taken against that person or against any other person who has acquired from that person an integrated circuit product that incorporates the topography or a substantial part thereof.




### Other Proceedings



**Detention of infringing integrated circuit products**

**14** 

- **(1)** Where it is made to appear to a court of competent jurisdiction that an integrated circuit product has been imported into Canada or is about to be commercially exploited in Canada contrary to this Act, the court may make an order for the interim detention of the integrated circuit product or any article of which the integrated circuit product forms a part, pending a final determination of the legality of the importation or commercial exploitation in an action commenced within such time as is specified in the order.

**Security**

- **(2)** Before an order is made under subsection (1), the plaintiff or petitioner may be required to furnish security, in such form and in such amount as the court may determine, to answer any damages that may by reason of the order be sustained by the owner or consignee of the integrated circuit product or article and for any costs of storage or amount that may become chargeable against the integrated circuit product or article while it remains in detention under the order.

**Indemnity**

- **(3)** Subject to paragraph (4)(c), the plaintiff or petitioner in an action referred to in subsection (1) shall be liable to indemnify Her Majesty in right of Canada against any liability or expense that may result from the detention of an integrated circuit product or article pursuant to any order made under subsection (1), whether or not security is furnished pursuant to subsection (2).

**Lien, disposal and indemnity**

- **(4)** Where, by the judgment in an action referred to in subsection (1) that finally determines the legality of the importation or commercial exploitation of the integrated circuit product, the court finds that the importation is or the commercial exploitation would be contrary to this Act,
	- **(a)** any lien for charges against the integrated circuit product or article, or any hypothecs, prior claims or rights of retention within the meaning of the Civil Code of Québec or any other statute of the Province of Quebec with respect to the integrated circuit product or article, that existed prior to the date of an order made under subsection (1) has effect only so far as may be consistent with the due execution of the judgment;
