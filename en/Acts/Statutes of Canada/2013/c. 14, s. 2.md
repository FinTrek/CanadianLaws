**Consultation**

- **(2)** The Board may only make an inclusion under paragraph (1)(a) or an exclusion under paragraph (1)(b) after consulting with the proponent in respect of the contemplated changes and taking into account any comments the proponent may make in respect of them.

**Process suspended**

- **(3)** If the Board makes an inclusion under paragraph (1)(a), it must not proceed with the screening and the Commission and the federal Minister or the territorial Minister, or both, must exercise their powers and perform their duties and functions under sections 77, 81 and 82 in relation to the entire project.




**Screening**

**87** 

- **(1)** The Board must screen the project if it makes no inclusion under paragraph 86(1)(a) or if it makes an inclusion under that paragraph and the Commission, after exercising its powers and performing its duties and functions in relation to the entire project, comes to the conclusion referred to in section 79 or subsection 80(1).

**Limitation**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, the Board is not authorized to screen a project if the Commission has determined, under section 77, that the project is not in conformity with any applicable land use plan and no minor variance or ministerial exemption has been granted in respect of the project under paragraph 81(2)(a) or 82(2)(a), as the case may be.




**Purpose of screening**

**88** The purpose of screening a project is to determine whether the project has the potential to result in significant ecosystemic or socio-economic impacts and, accordingly, whether it requires a review by the Board or by a federal environmental assessment panel, as the case may be.




**Project to be reviewed**

**89** 

- **(1)** The Board must be guided by the following considerations when it is called on to determine, on the completion of a screening, whether a review of the project is required:
	- **(a)** a review is required if, in the Board’s opinion,
		- **(i)** the project may have significant adverse ecosystemic or socio-economic impacts or significant adverse impacts on wildlife habitat or Inuit harvest activities,
		- **(ii)** the project will cause significant public concern, or
		- **(iii)** the project involves technological innovations, the effects of which are unknown; and
	- **(b)** a review is not required if, in the Board’s opinion,
		- **(i)** the project is unlikely to cause significant public concern, and
		- **(ii)** its adverse ecosystemic and socio-economic impacts are unlikely to be significant, or are highly predictable and can be adequately mitigated by known technologies.

**Prevailing considerations**

- **(2)** The considerations set out in paragraph (1)(a) prevail over those set out in paragraph (1)(b).

**Definition of harvest**

- **(3)** In subparagraph (1)(a)(i), ***harvest*** has the same meaning as in section 1.1.1 of the Agreement.




**Significance of impacts — factors**

**90** In determining the significance of impacts for the purposes of section 88 and subparagraphs 89(1)(a)(i) and (b)(ii), the Board must take into account the following factors:
- **(a)** the size of the geographic area, including the size of wildlife habitats, likely to be affected by the impacts;
- **(b)** the ecosystemic sensitivity of that area;
- **(c)** the historical, cultural and archaeological significance of that area;
- **(d)** the size of the human and the animal populations likely to be affected by the impacts;
- **(e)** the nature, magnitude and complexity of the impacts;
- **(f)** the probability of the impacts occurring;
- **(g)** the frequency and duration of the impacts;
- **(h)** the reversibility or irreversibility of the impacts;
- **(i)** the cumulative impacts that could result from the impacts of the project combined with those of any other project that has been carried out, is being carried out or is likely to be carried out; and
- **(j)** any other factor that the Board considers relevant to the assessment of the significance of impacts.




**Project to be modified or abandoned**

**91** The Board must make a determination that a project should be modified or abandoned if the Board is of the opinion that the project has the potential to result in unacceptable adverse ecosystemic or socio-economic impacts.




**Report — Board**

**92** 

- **(1)** The Board must submit a written report to the responsible Minister containing a description of the project that specifies its scope and indicating that

	- **(a)** recommend specific terms and conditions to apply in respect of a project that it determines may be carried out without a review;
	- **(b)** identify particular issues or concerns that should be considered in the review of a project that it determines should be reviewed; and
	- **(c)** provide information regarding the nature and extent of the regional impacts of a project that the responsible Minister must take into account when determining whether a project is in the regional interest.

**Time of report**

- **(3)** The Board must submit the report and the project proposal to the responsible Minister within a period that allows the relevant regulatory authorities to issue, within any period prescribed by law or regulation, a licence, permit or other authorization in respect of the project or, if it is earlier, within 45 days after the latest of
	- **(a)** the day on which the Board receives the project proposal under section 79 or subsection 80(1),
	- **(b)** the day on which the Board receives any information that is required under subsection 144(1), and
	- **(c)** the day on which the Board receives a decision, by reason of subsection 86(3), that the project is in conformity with any applicable land use plan, that a minor variance or a ministerial exemption has been granted in respect of it or that there is no land use plan applicable to the project.

**Extension of time limit**

- **(4)** If the responsible Minister is of the opinion that more time is needed for the Board to submit the report, that Minister may extend the period referred to in subsection (3) and must notify the proponent and the Board of the extension in writing.

**94** 

- **(1)** If the Board determines that a review of the project is required, the responsible Minister must, within 90 days after receiving the Board’s report, either
	- **(a)** agree with that determination and send the project proposal
		- **(i)** to the Minister of the Environment in order that a federal environmental assessment panel conduct the review if the project involves a matter of national interest and the responsible Minister — after consultation with the Minister of the Environment, the territorial minister and the Board — determines that it is more appropriate for the review to be conducted by such a panel than by the Board,
		- **(ii)** to the Minister of the Environment in order that a federal environmental assessment panel or a joint panel conduct the review, as the case may be, if the project is to be carried out partly outside the designated area,
		- **(iii)** despite subparagraph (ii), to the Board to conduct the review if the project is to be carried out partly outside the designated area and the responsible Minister, the Minister of the Environment and the Board determine that the review is to be conducted by the Board, or
		- **(iv)** to the Board for a review in any other case; or
	- **(b)** reject that determination if in that Minister’s opinion the project is not in the national or regional interest, and indicate in that Minister’s decision either that the project could be modified and an amended project proposal submitted to the Commission or that the project is not to proceed.

**Limit**

- **(2)** The responsible Minister may only send a project proposal to the Minister of the Environment under subparagraph (1)(a)(i) on an exceptional basis.

**Transportation of persons or goods**

- **(3)** Despite subparagraphs (1)(a)(ii) and (iii), if the only activity relating to a project to be carried out outside the designated area is the transportation of persons or goods, the responsible Minister must send the project proposal to the Board to conduct the review unless that Minister determines that the transportation of persons or goods is a significant element of the project and that it is more appropriate for the review to be conducted by a federal environmental assessment panel or a joint panel, as the case may be, than by the Board and the Minister of the Environment agrees with that determination.

**Consultation**

- **(4)** In exercising the powers and performing the duties and functions under subsection (3), the responsible Minister may consult with the Board and the Minister of Environment.

**Territorial minister**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, a regulatory authority may impose, to the extent of its jurisdiction and authority to do so, terms and conditions that are in addition to, or more stringent than, those referred to in subsection 136(1) and subsection (1) does not prevent a regulatory authority from refusing to issue a permit, licence or other authorization.

**Consultation**

- **(3)** A regulatory authority must consult the Board with a view to determining the most effective means of implementing the terms and conditions referred to in subsection (1) and may, for that purpose, send a draft licence, permit or other authorization to the Board in order to obtain its comments and recommendations.

- **(5)** The validity of a licence, permit or other authorization is not to be challenged before a court on the grounds that a regulatory authority fettered its discretion or acted without jurisdiction by incorporating the terms and conditions referred to in subsection (1) into it.




**Prevailing terms and conditions**

**138** Terms and conditions referred to in subsection 136(1) prevail over any conflicting terms and conditions set out in any decision of a regulatory authority.




**Decision of independent regulatory agency**

**139** 

- **(1)** If there is an inconsistency between the terms and conditions referred to in subsection 136(1) and those set out in a decision of an independent regulatory agency, that agency must communicate the reasons for the inconsistency to the responsible Minister, the Board and the Governor in Council.

**Exception — prevailing terms and conditions**

- **(2)** Despite section 138, if there is a conflict between the terms and conditions referred to in subsection 136(1) and those set out in a decision of an independent regulatory agency, the terms and conditions set out in the decision of the independent regulatory agency prevail if
	- **(a)** the government does not have the power to amend the agency’s decision and the Governor in Council is of the opinion that the project is in the national or regional interest; or
	- **(b)** the government has the power to amend the agency’s decision and the Governor in Council is of the opinion that the project is in the national or regional interest and implementing the terms and conditions referred to in subsection 136(1) would undermine the viability of the project.

**Interpretation**

- **(6)** A decision
	- **(a)** does not cease to be a decision of an independent regulatory agency solely because
		- **(i)** it is subject to general direction by the Government of Canada or the Government of Nunavut through the issuance of guidelines, regulations or directives, or
		- **(ii)** it is subject to the approval of, or may be varied or rescinded by, the Government of Canada or the Government of Nunavut; and
