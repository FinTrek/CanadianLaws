- **(2)** An interest or right in First Nation land obtained under section 35 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md) or held by Her Majesty is not subject to expropriation by a First Nation.

**Effective date**

- **(3)** An expropriation takes effect from the day on which a notice of expropriation is registered in the First Nation Land Register or the thirtieth day after the day on which the notice is served on the person whose interest or right is expropriated, whichever is the earlier.

- **(4)** An expropriated interest becomes the property of the First Nation free of any previous claim or encumbrance. In Quebec, a First Nation becomes the holder of an expropriated right free of any previous right, charge or claim.

**30** If less than the full interest of a First Nation, or less than the entire right of a First Nation, in First Nation land is expropriated by Her Majesty,
- **(a)** the land in which an interest or right is expropriated continues to be First Nation land and subject to the provisions of the land code and First Nation laws that are not inconsistent with the expropriation; and
- **(b)** the First Nation continues to have the right to use and occupy that land except to the extent that the use and occupation is inconsistent with the expropriation.
> 1999, c. 24, s. 30; 2007, c. 17, s. 13; 2012, c. 19, s. 652(E).

**Land of a lesser area**

- **(2)** Land provided to a First Nation as compensation may be of an area that is less than the area of the land in which an interest or right has been expropriated if the total area of the land comprised in a reserve of the First Nation is not less following the expropriation than at the coming into force of its land code.

**Determination of compensation**

- **(3)** The total compensation shall be determined taking into account the following factors:

	- **(b)** the replacement value of any improvement to the land;
	- **(c)** any expenses or losses resulting from a disturbance attributable to the expropriation;
	- **(d)** any reduction in the value of any interest or right in First Nation land that is not expropriated;
	- **(e)** any adverse effect on any cultural or other special value of the land to the First Nation; and
	- **(f)** the value of any special economic advantage arising out of or incidental to the occupation or use of the land to the extent that that value is not otherwise compensated.

**Interest**

- **(4)** Interest is payable on compensation from the effective date of an expropriation at the prejudgment interest rate that is paid in civil proceedings in the superior court of the province in which the land is situated.

**Dispute**

- **(5)** If an agreement on compensation cannot be reached, the First Nation or the expropriating department or agency may refer the matter to an arbitrator in accordance with the Framework Agreement.

**Limit**

- **(6)** Any claim or encumbrance in respect of an interest expropriated by Her Majesty may only be made or discharged against the compensation paid under this section.

**Improvements**

- **(2)** When an interest or right reverts or is returned to a First Nation, the minister responsible for the expropriating department or agency shall determine the disposition of any improvements made to the land.

**Dispute**

- **(3)** If the First Nation and the expropriating department or agency cannot agree on the terms and conditions of the return of the full interest or of the entire right, the First Nation or the department or agency may, in accordance with the Framework Agreement, refer the matter to an arbitrator.
