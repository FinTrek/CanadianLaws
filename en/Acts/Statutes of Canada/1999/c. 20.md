Assented to on 17 June 1999

----------




**Preamble**

WHEREAS the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America on Air Transport Preclearance was entered into on May 8, 1974;

WHEREAS since that date it has become desirable to put in place statutory authority, on a reciprocal basis in both Canada and the United States, to facilitate the movement of travellers and goods across the border between the two countries by all means of transportation;

WHEREAS it would facilitate cross-border travel and movement of goods if those provisions of American law directly related to the admission of travellers and the importation of goods into the United States, but excluding criminal law, were allowed to be administered in Canada;

AND WHEREAS the administration of any provision of American law in Canada is subject to Canadian law, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the [Canadian Bill of Rights](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1960/c.%2044.md) and the [Canadian Human Rights Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/H/H-6.md);
