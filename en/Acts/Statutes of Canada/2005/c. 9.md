# First Nations Fiscal Management Act

**S.C. 2005, c. 9**


Assented to on 23 March 2005

----------




**Preamble**

Whereas the Government of Canada has adopted a policy recognizing the inherent right of self-government as an Aboriginal right and providing for the negotiation of self-government;

Whereas this Act is not intended to define the nature and scope of any right of self-government or to prejudge the outcome of any self-government negotiation;

Whereas the creation of national Aboriginal institutions will assist First Nations that choose to exercise real property taxation jurisdiction on reserve lands;

Whereas economic development through the application of real property tax revenues and other local revenues to support borrowing on capital markets for the development of public infrastructure is available to other governments in Canada;

Whereas real property taxation regimes on reserves should recognize both the interests of on-reserve taxpayers and the rights of members of First Nations communities;

Whereas First Nations led an initiative that resulted in 1988 in an amendment to the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md) so that their jurisdiction over real property taxation on reserve could be exercised and the Indian Taxation Advisory Board was created to assist in the exercise of that jurisdiction;

Whereas, in 1995, the First Nations Finance Authority Inc. was incorporated for the purposes of issuing debentures using real property tax revenues and providing investment opportunities;

Whereas, by 1999, First Nations and the Government of Canada recognized the benefits of establishing statutory institutions as part of a comprehensive fiscal management system;

And whereas First Nations have led an initiative culminating in the introduction of this Act;



NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:


> 2005, c. 9, Preamble; 2012, c. 19, s. 657; 2018, c. 27, ss. 413(E), 414(E)..
