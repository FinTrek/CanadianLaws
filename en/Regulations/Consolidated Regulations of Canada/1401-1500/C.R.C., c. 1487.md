### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(s. 9)**
## Tonnage Ready Measurement Formula

### For Small Craft Exempt from Registry

**1** For the purpose of an application for a vessel licence pursuant to these Regulations, the register tonnage of a small vessel may be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.



### Gross Tonnage

**2** The gross tonnage is the tonnage of the hull plus the tonnage of the superstructure, if any.



### Register (Net) Tonnage

**3** The register tonnage is the gross tonnage less the allowance for engine space.



### Hull

**4** The tonnage of the hull is computed as follows, all measurements being in metres:
```
Hull = (L × B × D × .55) / 2.83
```
where
- **L** = length from fore part of head of stem to after part of head of stern post
- **B** = Breadth to the outside of outer planking excluding any moulding or rubbing strake
- **D** = depth amidships from under side of deck, or from upper strake of hull planking in open boats, to the upper side of floor timbers at side of keelson.

**NOTE:** Floor timbers are the bottom solid transverse timbers connecting the side frames.





### Superstructure

**5** The tonnage of any closed in erection above the deck line is computed as follows, all measurements being in metres:
```
Superstructure = (L × B × D) / 2.83
```
where
- **L** = length of superstructure
- **B** = breadth of superstructure
- **D** = depth of superstructure



### Engine Space

**6** The allowance for engine space is computed as follows, all measurements being in metres:
```
Engine space allowance = (L × B × D × 1.75) / 2.83
```
where
- **L** = length of engine space
- **B** = breadth of engine space
- **D** = depth of engine space

**NOTE:** There is no allowance for engine space in vessels propelled by outboard motors.
