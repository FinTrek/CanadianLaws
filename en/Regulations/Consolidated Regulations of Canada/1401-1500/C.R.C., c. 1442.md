### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(ss. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 18)**
## Freeboards and Markings

### Interpretation


**1** 

**(1)** In this Schedule,

***amidships*** means the middle of the length of the summer load water line as defined in subsection (2); (*milieu du navire*)

***Assigning Authority*** means the Chairman or a classification society authorized pursuant to section 421 of the Act; (*autorité habilitée*)

***flush deck ship*** means a ship that has no superstructure on the freeboard deck; (*navire à pont ras*)

***freeboard deck*** means the uppermost complete deck having permanent means of closing all openings in weather portions of the deck in accordance with sections 3 to 10 of this Schedule and, in flush deck ships and ships with detached superstructures, means the upper deck; in ships having discontinuous freeboard decks within superstructures that are not intact, or that are not fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, the lowest line of the deck below the superstructure deck shall be deemed to be the freeboard deck; (*pont de franc-bord*)

***superstructure*** means a decked structure on the freeboard deck extending from side to side of a ship and includes a raised quarter deck; (*superstructure*)

***superstructure deck*** means the deck forming the top of a superstructure; (*pont de superstructure*)

***surveyor*** means an inspector or a person authorized by an Assigning Authority to conduct surveys; (*expert maritime*)

***tanker freeboard*** means a freeboard assigned under Part III of this Schedule. (*franc-bord de navire-citerne*)



**(2)** The length (L) for the purposes of these Rules is the length in metres on the summer load water line from the foreside of the stem to the afterside of the rudder post; where there is no rudder post, the length is to be measured from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock; for ships with cruiser sterns, the length shall be taken as 96 per cent of the length on the designed summer load water line or as the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock if that be the greater.



**(3)** The breadth (B) for the purposes of these Rules is the maximum breadth in metres amidships measured to the moulded line of the frame in iron or steel ships, and to the outside of the planking in wood or composite ships.



**(4)** The moulded depth is the vertical distance in metres, measured amidships, from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side; in wood or composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet; where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the depth is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.



**(5)** The depth (D) for the purposes of these Rules is

**(a)** the moulded depth plus the thickness of the stringer plate or plus

(T(L-S)) ÷ (L)



if that be greater, where T is the mean thickness of the exposed deck clear of deck openings, and S is the total length of superstructures as defined in subsection (9);





**(b)** where the topsides are of unusual form, D is the depth of a midship section having vertical topsides, standard round of beam and area of topside section equal to that in the actual midship section; where there is a step or break in the topsides (e.g., in the turret deckship) 70 per cent of the area above the step or break is included in the area used to determine the equivalent section; and



**(c)** in a ship without an enclosed superstructure covering at least 0.6L amidships, without a complete trunk or without a combination of intact partial superstructures and trunk extending all fore and aft, the depth to be used with the table set out in section 48 of this Schedule shall not be less than

(L) ÷ (15)



in ships below 106.7 m in length, or less than that shown in the following table for lengths of 106.7 m and above; the minimum depths at intermediate lengths are to be obtained by interpolation.

**(6)** the coefficient of fineness (c) for the purposes of these Rules is given by the formula
```
c =(Δ) ÷ (L.B.<sub>1</sub>)
```
where
- **Δ** is the volume in cubic metres of the ships’s moulded displacement (excluding bossing) at a mean moulded draught d<sub>1</sub> which is 85 per cent of the moulded depth; and where the coefficient (c) is not taken as less than 0.68.



**(7)** The height of a superstructure is the least vertical height measured from the top of the superstructure deck to the top of the freeboard deck beams minus the difference between the moulded depth and D.



**(8)** The standard height of a raised quarter deck is 0.91 m for ships up to and including 30.5 m in length, 1.22 m for ships 76.2 m in length, and 1.83 m for ships 121.9 m in length and above; the standard height of any other superstructure or of a trunk is 1.83 m for ships up to and including 76.2 m in length and 2.29 m for ships 121.9 m in length and above; the standard height at intermediate lengths is obtained by interpolation.



**(9)** The length of a superstructure (S) is the mean covered length of the parts of the superstructure that extend to the sides of the ship and lie within lines drawn perpendicular to the extremities of the summer load water line, as defined in subsection (2).



**(10)** A detached superstructure is regarded as enclosed only where

**(a)** the enclosing bulkheads are of efficient construction as required by subsection (11);



**(b)** the access openings in the enclosing bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 or Class 2 closing appliances;



**(c)** all other openings in sides or ends of the superstructure are fitted with efficient weathertight means of closing; and



**(d)** independent means of access to crew, machinery, bunker and other working spaces within bridges and poops are at all times available when the bulkhead openings are closed.





**(11)** Bulkheads at exposed ends of poops, bridges and forecastles are deemed to be of efficient construction where the Assigning Authority is satisfied that, in the circumstances, they are equivalent to the following standard for ships with minimum freeboards, under which standard the stiffeners and plating are of the scantlings given in the table hereinafter contained, the stiffeners are spaced 760 mm apart, the stiffeners on poop and bridge front bulkheads have efficient end connections, and those on after bulkheads of bridges and forecastles extend for the whole distance between the margin angles of the bulkheads.



**(12)** Class 1 closing appliances are constructed of iron or steel, are in all cases permanently and strongly attached to the bulkhead, are framed, stiffened and fitted so that the whole structure is of equivalent strength to the unpierced bulkhead and are weathertight when closed; the means for securing these appliances is permanently attached to the bulkhead or to the appliances and the latter is so arranged that they can be closed and secured from both sides of the bulkhead or from the deck above; the sills of the access openings are at least 305 mm above the deck.



**(13)** Class 2 closing appliances include the following:

**(a)** strongly framed hardwood hinged doors, which are not more than 760 mm wide or less than 50 mm thick;



**(b)** shifting boards fitted for the full height of the openings in channels riveted to the bulkheads, the shifting boards being at least 50 mm thick where the width of opening is 760 mm or less, and increased in thickness at the rate of 25 mm for each additional 380 mm of width; or



**(c)** portable plates of equal efficiency with the appliances specified in paragraphs (a) or (b).

### Strength


**26** 

**(1)** The Assigning Authority shall be satisfied with the structural strength of any ship before assigning to it a freeboard.



**(2)** Ships that comply with the highest standard of the rules of a classification society recognized for this purpose by the Minister shall be regarded as having sufficient strength for the minimum freeboards allowed under these Rules.



**(3)** Ships that do not comply with the highest standard of the rules of a classification society recognized for this purpose by the Minister shall be assigned such increased freeboards as shall be determined by the Assigning Authority, having regard to the extent in which the ship complies with the following strength moduli:

**(a)** Material: The strength moduli are based on the assumption that the structure is built of mild steel, manufactured by the open hearth process (acid or basic) and having a tensile strength of 401 to 494 MPa, and an elongation of at least 16 per cent on a length of 203 mm.



Strength Deck: The strength deck is the uppermost deck which is incorporated into and forms an integral part of the longitudinal girder within the half-length amidships.



Depth to Strength Deck (D<sub>s</sub>): The depth to the strength deck is the vertical distance in metres amidships from the top of the keel to the top of the strength deck beam at side.



Draught (d): The draught is the vertical distance in metres amidships from the top of the keel to the centre of the diamond, provided that where a midsummer load line is assigned the draught shall be the draught to that load line.



**(b)** Longitudinal Modulus: The longitudinal modulus

(I) ÷ (y)





is the moment of inertia I of the midship section about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the top of the strength deck beam at side, calculated in way of openings but without deductions for rivet holes; areas shall be measured in square centimetres and distances in metres.



Below the strength deck all continuous longitudinal members, other than such parts of the under deck girders as are required entirely for supporting purposes, are included; above the strength deck the gunwale angle bar and the extension of the sheerstrake are the only members included.



The required longitudinal modulus for effective material is expressed by the formula, f.d.B., where f is the factor obtained from the following table:

does not exceed 13.5 in ships of 99.1 m in length and under, and 19 in ships of 182.9 m in length and above. Intermediate values for lengths between 99.1 m and 182.9 m are to be obtained by interpolation.







Where the length of a ship is in excess of 182.9 m and the ratio

(L) ÷ (<sub>s</sub>)



exceeds 19 the factor f is to be increased to the satisfaction of the Board.





**(c)** Frame: For the purpose of the frame modulus, the frame is regarded as composed of a frame angle and a reverse angle each of the same size and thickness.



Frame Modulus: The modulus

(I) ÷ (y)





of the midship frame below the lowest tier of beams is the moment of inertia I of the frame section about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the extremity of the frame section, calculated without deduction for rivet and bolt holes. The modulus is measured in centimetre units.



The required frame modulus is expressed by the formula


```
(s(d - t) (<sub>1</sub> + <sub>2</sub>)) ÷ (1 000)
```
where
- **s** is the frame spacing in metres;
- **t** is the vertical distance in metres measured at amidships from the top of the keel to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (see Figure 2); where there is no double bottom, t is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side;
- **f** <sub>1</sub>is a coefficient depending on H, which, in ships fitted with double bottoms, is the vertical distance in metres from the middle of the beam bracket of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (see Figure 2). Where there is no double bottom, H is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side. Where the frame obtains additional strength from the form of the ship, due allowance is made in the value of f<sub>1</sub>;
- **f** <sub>2</sub>is a coefficient depending on K, which is the vertical distance in metres from the top of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point 2.29 m above the freeboard deck at side, or, if there is a superstructure, to a point 3.81 m above the freeboard deck at side (see Figure 2). The values of f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are obtained from the following table:

Intermediate values are obtained by interpolation.



This formula applies where D is between 4.57 m and 18.29 m, both inclusive, B is between (L) ÷ (10) + 1.52 and (L) ÷ (10) + 6.1 both inclusive, (L) ÷ (<sub>s</sub>) does not exceed 13.5 in ships of 99.1 m in length and under, and 19 in ships of 182.9 m in length and above, (intermediate values between lengths of 99.1 m and 182.9 m are to be obtained by interpolation), and the horizontal distance from the outside frame to the centre of the first row of pillars does not exceed 6.1 m.



In single deck ships of ordinary form, where H does not exceed 5.5 m, the frame modulus determined by the preceding method is multiplied by the factor f<sub>3</sub>, where



f<sub>3</sub> = 0.50 + 0.164 (H - 2.44).

### Sheer


**38** 

**(1)** The sheer shall be measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line at amidships.



**(2)** In ships designed to trim by the stern in service, the sheer may be measured in relation to the load line, provided an additional mark is placed at 0.25L forward of amidships, to indicate the assigned load line. This mark is to be similar to the load line diamond amidships.



**(3)** In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures, the sheer shall be measured at the freeboard deck.



**(4)** In ships with top sides of unusual form in which there is a step or break in the top sides, the sheer shall be considered in relation to the equivalent depth amidships determined in accordance with subsection 1(5) of this Schedule.



**(5)** In ships with a superstructure of standard height that extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer shall be measured at the superstructure deck; where the height exceeds the standard, the sheer may be considered in relation to the standard height.



**(6)** Where a superstructure is intact or access openings in its enclosing bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, and the superstructure deck has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck shall not be taken into account.





**39** The ordinates (in millimetres) of the standard sheer profile are given in the following table, where L is the number of metres in the length of the ship:

**(1)** Where the sheer profile differs from the standard, the seven ordinates of each profile shall be multiplied by the appropriate factors given in the table of ordinates; the difference between the sums of the respective products, divided by 18, measures the deficiency or excess of sheer.



**(2)** Where the after half of the sheer profile is greater than the standard and the forward half is less than the standard, no credit shall be allowed for the part in excess.



**(3)** Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the standard, and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than 75 per cent of the standard, credit shall be allowed for the part in excess; where the after part is less than 50 per cent of the standard, no credit shall be given for the excess sheer forward; where the after sheer is between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the standard, an intermediate allowance may be granted for excess sheer forward.





**41** The correction for variations from the standard sheer shall be the deficiency or excess of sheer determined in accordance with section 40 multiplied by


```
0.75 - (S) ÷ (2L)
```
where
- **S** is the total length of the superstructure.





**42** Where the sheer is less than the standard, the correction for deficiency in sheer, determined in accordance with section 41, shall be added to the freeboard.



**43** In flush deck ships and in ships where an enclosed superstructure covers 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the correction for excess of sheer determined in accordance with section 41 shall be deducted from the freeboard; in ships with detached superstructure where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no deduction for excess of sheer shall be made from the freeboard; where an enclosed superstructure covers less than 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the deduction for excess of sheer shall be obtained by interpolation; the maximum deduction for excess of sheer shall be 125 mm at 100 m length of ship and shall increase at the rate of 125 mm for each additional 100 m in the length of the ship.



### Round of Beam


**44** The standard round of beam of the freeboard deck is greater than one-fiftieth of the breadth of the ship.



**45** Where the round of beam of the freeboard is greater or less than the standard, the freeboard shall be decreased or increased respectively by one-fourth of the difference between the actual and the standard round of beam, multiplied by the proportion of the length of the freeboard deck not covered by enclosed superstructures; twice the standard round of beam is the maximum for which allowance may be given.



### Minimum Freeboards


**46** The minimum freeboard in summer shall be the freeboard derived from the table set out in section 50 after correction for departures from the standards and after deduction for superstructures in accordance with these Rules, and if the freeboard, calculated in accordance with these Rules but before the correction required by note (f) appended to the table is made, is less than 50 mm, 50 mm shall be substituted therefor.



**47** The minimum freeboard in midsummer may be obtained by a deduction from the summer freeboard as defined in section 46, of a distance in millimetres obtained by multiplying 25 by the summer draught in metres measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the load line diamond, but in no case shall the freeboard be less than 50 mm.



**48** The minimum freeboards for the intermediate and winter seasons shall be obtained by an addition to the summer freeboard of a distance in millimetres obtained by multiplying the summer draught in metres measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the load line diamond by the appropriate factors set out in the table.

**(1)** The depth (D) to be used in computing the freeboards for sailing ships shall be obtained in the same manner as given in subsection 1(5) provided that in sailing ships having a greater rate of rise of floor than 125 mm per metre, the vertical distance from the top of keel referred to in subsection 1(4) shall be reduced by half the difference between the total rise of floor at the half-breadth of the ship and the total rise at 125 mm per metre; 208 mm per metre of half-breadth is the maximum rate of rise for which a deduction may be made.



**(2)** Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character or thick garboards are fitted, the depth shall be measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.



**(3)** The depth used with the freeboard table shall be taken as not less than

(L) ÷ (12)







**59** The coefficient of fineness c used with the freeboard table contained in section 63 shall be taken as not less than 0.62 and not greater than 0.72.



**60** In wood ships the Assigning Authority shall be satisfied as to the efficiency of the construction and closing arrangements of superstructures for which deductions are made from the freeboard.



**61** Where the effective length of superstructures is 1.0L, the deduction from the freeboard shall be 78 mm at 25 m length of ship, and 457 mm at 70 m length; deductions at intermediate lengths shall be obtained by interpolation; where the total effective length of superstructure is less than 1.0L, the deduction shall be a percentage obtained from the following table:

**(d)** Where the actual depth to the surface of the freeboard deck amidships is greater or less than D, the difference between these two depths (in millimetres) shall be added to or deducted from the freeboard, as the case may be.



**(e)** The freeboards for sailing ships above 70.1 m in length shall be specially considered, and the assigned freeboards are to be approved by the Board before a certificate is issued.



**64** The freeboard for a wood sailing ship is the final freeboard the ship would obtain if constructed of iron or steel with the addition of such penalties as the Assigning Authority may determine, having regard to the classification, construction, age and condition of the ship.



**PART V** 
## Load Line Marks


**65** On receiving from the Assigning Authority the particulars as to the deck line and load lines the owner shall cause to be marked on each side of the ship, to the satisfaction of the surveyor, the appropriate marks in accordance with this Part.



**66** The diamond, lines and letters described in section 67, shall be marked in such manner as, in the surveyor’s opinion, will make them plainly visible: they shall be painted in white or yellow on a dark ground, or in black on a light ground, and shall also be carefully cut in or centre-punched on the sides of iron and steel ships, and on wood ships shall be cut into the planking for at least 3 mm.



**67** A steamship shall be marked on each side with a deck line and load lines as follows:

**(a)** a deck line which shall be a horizontal line 300 mm in length and 25 mm in breadth marked amidships with its upper edge passing through the point where the continuation outwards of the upper surface of the freeboard deck intersects the outer surface of the shell, (see Figure 1); where the deck is partly sheathed amidships, the upper edge of the deck line shall pass through the point where the continuation outwards of the upper surface of the actual sheathing at amidships intersects the outer surface of the shell;



**(b)** a load line diamond which shall be a square 380 mm on each diagonal with one diagonal vertical and which shall be intersected by a horizontal line 540 mm in length and 25 mm in breadth, the upper edge of which shall coincide with the horizontal diagonal of the diamond; the diamond shall be marked amidships, below the deck line;



**(c)** horizontal lines, 230 mm in length and 25 mm in breadth, which extend from and are at right angles to a vertical line marked either 540 mm forward of the centre of the diamond (see Figure 1A) in the case of ships operating in fresh water or 660 mm forward of the centre of the diamond (see Figure 1B) in the case of ships operating in salt water within the inland waters limits, which lines indicate the maximum depth to which the ship may be loaded in different circumstances and in different seasons; these lines are as follows:

**(i)** the midsummer line, applicable only to cargo steamships, including tankers, non-propelled cargo ships of shipshape form, and non-propelled tankers of shipshape form, indicated by the upper edge of a line extending forward from the vertical line referred to above, marked “MS”;



**(ii)** the summer load line, indicated by the upper edge of a line which passes through the centre of the diamond and also by the upper edge of a line extending forward from the vertical line referred to above, marked “S”;



**(iii)** the intermediate load line, indicated by the upper edge of a line extending forward from the vertical line referred to above, marked “I”;



**(iv)** the winter load line, indicated by the upper edge of a line extending forward from the vertical line referred to above, marked “W”; and



**(v)** the corresponding salt water load lines, applicable only to ships that operate in salt water within the inland waters limits, indicated by the upper edges of lines extending aft from the vertical lines referred to above marked “MS”, “S”, “I” and “W” respectively (see Figure 1B); and



**(vi)** the letters “SW” shall be marked above the salt water freeboard marks and the letters “FW” shall be marked above the fresh water freeboard marks when both marks are required (see Figure 1B).

**68** A sailing ship shall be marked on each side with a deck line, a load line diamond, a summer load line, a winter load line and the corresponding salt water load lines as indicated in section 67 (see Figure 1B).



**69** For the purpose of indicating the name of the Assigning Authority by whom the freeboards have been assigned, letters measuring about 115 mm by 75 mm may be marked alongside the diamond and above the line through the centre of the diamond.



**PART VI** 
## Limits of Submergence


**70** 

**(1)** The maximum depth to which a steamship may be loaded in fresh water during the midsummer season, which is the period from May 1st to September 15th in any year, is the depth indicated by the midsummer load line.



**(2)** The maximum depth to which a steamship may be loaded in fresh water during the summer seasons, which are the periods from April 16th to April 30th and from September 16th to September 30th in any year, is the depth indicated by the summer load line.



**(3)** The maximum depth to which a steamship may be loaded in fresh water during the intermediate seasons, which are the periods from April 1st to April 15th and from October 1st to October 31st, in any year, is the depth indicated by the intermediate load line.



**(4)** The maximum depth to which a steamship may be loaded in fresh water during the winter season which is the period from November 1st in any year to March 31st in the next year, is the depth indicated by the winter load line.



**(5)** Notwithstanding anything in this season, when engaged on voyages between Sarnia, Ontario, and Toledo, Ohio, or Amherstburg, Ontario,

**(a)** cargo vessels, including tankers, that exceed 91.4 m in length but do not exceed 121.9 m, may load to their intermediate marks during the winter season, that is to say, during the period from November 1st in any year to March 1st in the year next following; and



**(b)** cargo vessels, including tankers, that exceed 121.9 m in length may load to their summer marks during both the intermediate and winter seasons, that is to say, during the period from October 1st in any year to April 15th in the year next following.





**(6)** The maximum depth to which a sailing ship may be loaded in fresh water during the summer and intermediate seasons, as in this Rule defined, is the depth indicated by the summer load line.



**(7)** The maximum depth to which a sailing ship may be loaded in fresh water during the winter season, as in this Rule defined, is the depth indicated by the winter load line.



**(8)** The maximum depth to which a steamship may be loaded during any season when in salt water and proceeding to fresh water, is the depth indicated by the appropriate seasonal mark, corrected as provided in section 49.
