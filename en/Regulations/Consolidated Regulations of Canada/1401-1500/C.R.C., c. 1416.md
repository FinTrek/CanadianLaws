### Rule 6


#### Safe Speed — International

Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.


In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:

**(a)** By all vessels:

**(i)** the state of visibility,



**(ii)** the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels,



**(iii)** the manoeuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions,



**(iv)** at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights,



**(v)** the state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards,

#### Safe Speed — Canadian Modifications

**(c)** In the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, every vessel passing another vessel or work that includes a dredge, tow, grounded vessel or wreck shall proceed with caution at a speed that will not adversely affect the vessel or work being passed, and shall comply with any relevant instruction or direction contained in any Notice to Mariners or Notice to Shipping.


**(d)** For the purpose of paragraph (c), where it cannot be determined with certainty that a passing vessel will not adversely affect another vessel or work described in that paragraph, the passing vessel shall proceed with caution at the minimum speed at which she can be kept on her course.


**(e)** [Repealed, SOR/2008-272, s. 10]



### Rule 7


#### Risk of Collision

**(a)** Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.


**(b)** Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.


**(c)** Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information.


**(d)** In determining if risk of collision exists the following considerations shall be among those taken into account:

**(i)** such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change,



**(ii)** such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range.





### Rule 8


#### Action to avoid Collision

**(a)** Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this Part and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.


**(b)** Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.


**(c)** If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.


**(d)** Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.


**(e)** If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.


**(f)** (i) A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the other vessel.

**(ii)** A vessel required not to impede the passage or the safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this latter obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the rules of this Part.



**(iii)** A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the rules of this Part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.





### Rule 9


#### Narrow Channels — International

**(a)** A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable.


**(b)** A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.


**(c)** A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.


**(d)** A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.


**(e)** (i) In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she may sound the signals prescribed in Rule 34(d).

**(ii)** This Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation under Rule 13.




**(f)** A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(e).


**(g)** Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.



#### Narrow Channels — Canadian Modifications

**(i)** Notwithstanding paragraph (e), in a narrow channel or fairway in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, a vessel shall indicate its intention to overtake, or its agreement to being overtaken, as the case may be, by sounding the whistle signals prescribed in Rule 34(j).


**(j)** In the Canadian waters of a narrow channel or fairway a barge or an inconspicuous, partly submerged vessel or object shall not be navigated, moored or anchored so as to impede the safe passage of any other vessel or object using those waters.


**(k)** Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and Rule 14(a), in the Canadian waters of a narrow channel or fairway where there is a current or tidal stream and two power-driven vessels are meeting each other from opposite directions so as to involve risk of collision,

**(i)** the vessel proceeding with the current or tidal stream shall be the stand-on vessel and shall propose the place of passage and shall indicate the side on which she intends to pass by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(a) or (g),



**(ii)** the vessel proceeding against the current or tidal stream shall keep out of the way of the vessel proceeding with the current or tidal stream and shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing,



**(iii)** the vessel proceeding against the current or tidal stream shall promptly reply to the signal referred to in subparagraph (i) with the same signal, if she is in agreement, and with the sound signal prescribed in Rule 34(d), if she is in doubt.





### Rule 10

**SECTION II — CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER** 


### Rule 11


#### Application

Rules in this Section apply to vessels in sight of one another.



### Rule 12


#### Sailing Vessels

**(a)** When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows:

**(i)** when each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other,



**(ii)** when both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward,



**(iii)** if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or on the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other.




**(b)** For the purposes of this Rule, the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.



### Rule 13


#### Overtaking — International

**(a)** Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of Part B, Sections I and II, any vessel overtaking any other vessel shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.


**(b)** A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.


**(c)** When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.


**(d)** Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.



#### Overtaking — Canadian Modification

**(e)** Notwithstanding paragraph (b), in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, a vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking if approaching another vessel from a direction more than 22.5° abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking that at night she would not be able to see either of the sidelights of the other vessel but would be able to see

**(i)** the sternlight of the other vessel, or



**(ii)** in the case of a power-driven vessel lighted in accordance with Rule 23(d) or (f), the all-round white light or lights of the other vessel.





### Rule 14


#### Head-on Situation

**(a)** When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.


**(b)** Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and/or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.


**(c)** When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly.



### Rule 15


#### Crossing Situation — International

**(a)** When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.



#### Crossing Situation — Canadian Modification

**(b)** Notwithstanding paragraph (a), in Canadian waters, a vessel crossing a river shall keep out of the way of a power-driven vessel ascending or descending the river, except on the St. Lawrence River seaward of Île Rouge.



### Rule 16


#### Action by Give-way Vessel

Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.



### Rule 17


#### Action by Stand-on Vessel

**(a)** (i) Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.

**(ii)** The latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.




**(b)** When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.


**(c)** A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with subparagraph (a)(ii) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.


**(d)** This Rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.



### Rule 18


#### Responsibilities between Vessels

Except where Rules 9, 10 and 13 otherwise require:

**(ii)** a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.





**(d)** (i) Any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draught, exhibiting the signals in Rule 28.

**(ii)** A vessel constrained by her draught shall navigate with particular caution having full regard to her special condition.





**(e)** A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall comply with the Rules of this Part.



**(f)** (i) A WIG craft shall, when taking off, landing and in flight near the surface, keep well clear of all other vessels and avoid impeding their navigation.

**(ii)** A WIG craft operating on the water surface shall comply with the Rules of this Part as a power-driven vessel.

**(c)** Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the Rules of Section I of this Part.


**(d)** A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing and/or risk of collision exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided:

**(i)** an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken,



**(ii)** an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.




**(e)** Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.

**ANNEX III** 
### TECHNICAL DETAILS OF SOUND SIGNAL APPLIANCES

**1** **Whistles — International**

**(a)** *Frequencies and range of audibility*

The fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 70-700 Hz. The range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the range 180-700 Hz (± 1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (± 1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in paragraph (c) below.





**(b)** *Limits of fundamental frequencies*

To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits:

**(i)** 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 metres or more in length,



**(ii)** 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 metres but less than 200 metres in length,



**(iii)** 250-700 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 metres in length.







**(c)** *Sound signal intensity and range of audibility*

A whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 metre from it, a sound pressure level in at least one 1/3<sup>rd</sup> octave band within the range of frequencies 180-700 Hz (± 1%) for a vessel 20 metres or more in length, or 180-2100 Hz (± 1%) for a vessel less than 20 metres in length, of not less than the appropriate figure given in the table below.

The range of audibility in the table above is for information and is approximately the range at which a whistle may be heard on its forward axis with 90 per cent probability in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centred on 250 Hz and 63 dB in the octave band centred on 500 Hz).



In practice the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends critically on weather conditions; the values given can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient noise level at the listening post the range may be much reduced.





**(d)** *Directional Properties*

The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more than 4 dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis at any direction in the horizontal plane within 45 degrees of the axis. The sound pressure level at any other direction in the horizontal plane shall be not more than 10 dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis, so that the range in any direction will be at least half the range on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be measured in that 3rd-octave band which determines the audibility range.





**(e)** *Positioning of Whistles*

When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on a vessel, it shall be installed with its maximum intensity directed straight ahead. A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure level of the vessel’s own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 dB (A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB (A).





**(f)** *Fitting of more than one whistle*

If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 metres, it shall be so arranged that they are not sounded simultaneously.





**(g)** *Combined whistle systems*

If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in paragraph 1(f) above is likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, it is recommended that a combined whistle system be fitted so as to overcome this reduction. For the purposes of the Rules a combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle. The whistles of a combined system shall be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 metres and arranges to be sounded simultaneously. The frequency of any one whistle shall differ from those of the others by at least 10 Hz.





#### Whistles — Canadian Modifications


**(h)** Notwithstanding paragraph (a), in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, the upper limit of the frequency range referred to in that paragraph may be expanded to be within the range of 180-2/100 Hz (± 1 per cent).



**(i)** Notwithstanding paragraph (c), in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, the whistle on a vessel of 12 metres or more in length but less than 20 metres in length may provide, in the direction of the forward axis of the whistle and at a distance of one metre from it, a sound pressure level in at least one 1/3rd-octave band of not less than the appropriate figure shown below within the frequency range of 250-2/100 Hz (± 1 per cent):

**(i)** 250-450 Hz — 120 dB



**(ii)** 450-800 Hz — 115 dB



**(iii)** 800-2 100 Hz — 111 dB





**(j)** For the purposes of this Annex, the expression “listening posts” means bridge wings or the bow.



**(k)** For the purposes of this Annex, the methods described in Resolution A.343(IX), made by the Organization, for measuring noise levels at listening posts are recommended.



**(l)** In the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a power-driven vessel that is normally engaged in pushing ahead or towing alongside may, at any time, use a whistle whose characteristics fall within the limits prescribed in paragraph (b) for the longest normal length of the vessel and its tow.




**2** **Bell or gong**

**(a)** *Intensity of Signal*

A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 dB at a distance of one metre from it.





**(b)** *Construction*

Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material and designed to give a clear tone. The diameter of the mouth of the bell shall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of 20 metres or more in length. Where practicable, a power-driven bell striker is recommended to ensure constant force but manual operation shall be possible. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 3% of the mass of the bell.






**3** **Approval — International**

**(a)** The construction of sound signal appliances, their performance and their installation on board a vessel shall be to the satisfaction of the appropriate authority of the State whose flag the vessel is entitled to fly.



#### Approval — Canadian Modification


**(b)** For the purpose of paragraph (a), the appropriate Canadian authority is the Minister.
