***Load Line Rules*** means the rules for the time being in force made under the provisions of section 416 of the [Canada Shipping Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-9.md); (*Règles sur les lignes de charge*)

***superstructure deck*** means the deck forming the top of a superstructure, as defined in the Load Line Rules; (*pont de superstructure*)

***timber load line*** means a special load line to be used only when a ship carrying a timber deck cargo complies with these Regulations and the Load Line Rules. (*ligne de charge pour bois en pontée*)




**PART I** 
## Vessels of 150 Tons Gross Tonnage and Upwards


**3** This Part applies to every vessel of 150 tons or more, gross tonnage, that carries a timber deck cargo into or out of Canada.



**4** Openings to spaces below the freeboard deck covered by cargo shall be securely closed and battened down; all fittings such as hatchway beams, fore-and-afters, and covers, shall be in place; where hold ventilation is needed, the ventilators shall be efficiently protected.



**5** 

- **(1)** The cargo shall be compactly stowed, lashed and secured; it shall not interfere in any way with the navigation and necessary working of the ship or with the provision of a safe margin of stability at all stages of the voyage, taking into account additions of weight such as those due to absorption of water and to losses of weight such as those due to consumption of fuel and stores.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (1), when a ship is within any of the areas set out in the schedule during the periods set out in the schedule, the height of the cargo above the freeboard deck shall not exceed one-third of the extreme breadth of the ship.



**6** Safe and satisfactory access to the quarters of the crew, to the machinery space and to all other parts used in the necessary working of the ship shall be available at all times; cargo in the way of openings that give access to such parts shall be so stowed that the openings can be properly closed and secured against the admission of water; efficient protection for the crew in the form of guard rails or life lines, spaced not more than 31 cm apart vertically, shall be provided on each side of the cargo to a height of at least 1.2 m above the cargo; the cargo shall be so stowed as to be sufficiently level for gangway purposes.
> SOR/79-586, s. 1.




**7** Steering arrangements shall be effectively protected from damage by the cargo and, as far as practicable, shall be accessible; efficient provision shall be made for steering in the event of a breakdown in the main steering arrangements.



**8** 

- **(1)** A complete system of overall lashings of ample strength and in good condition, fitted with releasing arrangements, shall be provided so as to give effective security throughout the length of the cargo; the releasing arrangements shall be accessible at all times; all fittings required for securing lashings shall be of strength corresponding to the strength of the lashings.

- **(2)** In ships not exceeding 500 tons, register tonnage, engaged on home trade voyages, the releasing arrangements may be replaced by rope lanyards on the centre line of the ship, readily accessible and capable of being cut and released when required.



**9** Where uprights are required by the nature of the cargo,
- **(a)** they shall be of adequate strength and may be of wood or metal;
- **(b)** the spacing shall be suitable for the length and characteristics of the cargo, but shall not exceed 3 m; and
- **(c)** efficient means shall be provided for securing the uprights.
> SOR/79-586, s. 2.





**PART II** 
## Vessels Using Timber Load Lines


**10** This Part applies to every vessel marked with a timber load line under the Load Line Rules when loaded beyond the maximum depth to which it would, for the time being, be entitled under the Load Line Rules to be loaded if it were not marked with a timber load line.



**11** The wells on the freeboard deck shall be filled with timber stowed as solidly as possible, to a height of at least,
- **(a)** 1.829 m for ships up to and including 76.2 m in length;
- **(b)** 2.286 m for ships 121.9 m or more in length; and
- **(c)** a proportionate intermediate height for ships more than 76.2 m but less than 121.9 m in length.
> SOR/79-586, s. 3.




**12** 

- **(1)** The cargo shall be efficiently secured throughout its length by independent overall lashings spaced not more than 3 m apart; overall lashings shall be in good condition and shall consist of close link chain of not less than 19 mm, or flexible wire rope of equivalent strength, fitted with sliphooks and stretching screws, that shall be accessible at all times; wire rope lashings shall have a sufficient length of long link chain to permit the length of lashings to be regulated.

- **(2)** When the timber is in lengths of less than 3.6 m, the spacing of the lashings shall be reduced to suit the length of timber, or other suitable provision shall be made.

- **(3)** When the spacing of the lashings is 1.5 m or less, the size of the lashings may be reduced, but not less than 13 mm chain or the equivalent of wire rope shall be used.
> SOR/79-586, s. 4.




**13** 

- **(1)** Uprights, when required by the nature of the cargo, shall be secured by strong angles or metal sockets efficiently attached to the stringer plate, or by equally efficient means.

- **(2)** When fitted on superstructure decks, uprights shall be secured by athwartship lashings of ample strength.




**PART III** 
## General


**14** 

- **(1)** A person directed by the Minister of Transport to make an inspection of a timber deck cargo shall be paid a fee of $25 for such inspection and a certificate thereof.
