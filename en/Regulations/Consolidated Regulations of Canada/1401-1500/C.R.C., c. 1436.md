## Equipment to Be Carried by New Ships



### Class I Ships
### (Ships that are over five tons gross tonnage and are (i) Safety Convention ships that are certified to carry more than 12 passengers on long international voyages, or (ii) ships that are not Safety Convention ships and that are certified to carry more than 12 passengers on foreign voyages or home-trade voyages, Class I)


**32** 

- **(1)** Subject to section 33, a Class I ship shall carry, on each side of the ship,
	- **(a)** enough lifeboats under gravity-type davits to accommodate at least 50 per cent of the complement; or
	- **(b)** enough lifeboats under gravity-type davits to accommodate at least 37.5 per cent of the complement and enough life rafts under launching devices to accommodate at least 12.5 per cent of the complement.

- **(2)** In addition to meeting the requirements of subsection (1), a Class I ship shall carry enough life rafts under launching devices to accommodate at least 25 per cent of the complement.

- **(3)** Lifeboats shall be partially enclosed or totally enclosed.
> SOR/96-218, s. 34.




**33** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (3), a Class I ship that is under 500 tons gross tonnage with a complement of fewer than 200 persons may carry, on each side of the ship, instead of the survival craft referred to in section 32, enough life rafts to accommodate
	- **(a)** the complement, if the life rafts are stowed in a location providing for easy side-to-side transfer at a single open-deck level; or
	- **(b)** 150 per cent of the complement, if the life rafts are not stowed in accordance with paragraph (a).

- **(2)** Where a rescue boat required under subsection 34(2) is certified as a lifeboat, its accommodation capacity may be included in the calculation under subsection (1) to reduce the number of life rafts required.

- **(3)** The number of life rafts necessary to fulfil the requirements of subsection (1) shall be calculated in such a way that, taking into account the percentage of the complement that could be accommodated in each, should any one life raft be lost or rendered unserviceable, enough life rafts remain on each side of the ship to accommodate the complement.
> SOR/96-218, s. 34.




**34** 

- **(1)** A Class I ship of 500 tons gross tonnage or over shall carry, on each side of the ship, at least one rescue boat under launching devices.

- **(2)** A Class I ship of under 500 tons gross tonnage shall carry at least one rescue boat under launching devices.
> SOR/96-218, s. 34.




**35** Every life raft on a Class I ship shall be stowed
- **(a)** with its painter permanently attached to the ship;
- **(b)** fitted with a float-free device;
- **(c)** so that it can be launched by one or two persons; and
- **(d)** if it is inflatable, so that it inflates automatically if the ship sinks.
> SOR/96-218, s. 34.




**36** A Class I ship shall carry enough lifeboats and rescue boats to ensure that, in providing for abandonment by the complement, each lifeboat or rescue boat need not marshal more than six life rafts.
> SOR/96-218, s. 34.




**37** A Class I ship within the length range set out in column I of an item of the table to this section shall carry the supply of equipment set out in columns II to V of that item.

**PART II** 
## Carrying Capacity

**12** The cubic capacity of a lifeboat shall be measured in cubic metres and, subject to section 15, may be determined by Stirling’s (Simpson’s) Rule, where
```
Cubic Capacity = L/12 (4A + 2B + 4C)
```
where L denotes the length of the lifeboat in metres from the inside of the planking or plating at the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post or to the inside of the transom where the lifeboat has a square stern, and where A, B and C denote respectively the area of the cross-sections at the quarter-length forward, amidships and the quarter-length aft, that correspond to the 3 points obtained by dividing L into 4 equal parts (the areas corresponding to the ends of the boat being considered negligible), and the areas A, B and C shall be deemed to be given in square metres by the successive application of the following formula to each of the 3 cross-sections:


```
Area = h/12 (a + 4b + 2c + 4d + e)
```
where h denotes the depth measured in metres inside the planking or plating, from the keel to the level of the gunwale or a greater depth, as determined in sections 13 and 14, and a, b, c, d and e denote the horizontal breadths of the lifeboat measured in metres inside the planking or plating at the upper and lower points of the depth and at the 3 points obtained by dividing h into 4 equal parts (a and e being the breadths at the extreme points, and c at the middle point of h), the capacity of a square sterned lifeboat being calculated as if the lifeboat had a pointed stern.




**13** If the sheer of the gunwale, measured at the two points situated at a quarter of the length of the lifeboat from the ends, exceeds one per cent of the length, the depth used in calculating the area of cross-sections A and C in section 12 shall be deemed to be the depth amidships plus one per cent of the length of the lifeboat.


**14** If the depth of the lifeboat amidships exceeds 45 per cent of the breadth, the depth used in calculating the area of the midship cross-section B shall be deemed to be equal to 45 per cent of the breadth, and the depth used in calculating the areas of the quarter-length sections A and C is obtained by increasing the last figure by an amount equal to one per cent of the length of the lifeboat, but in no case shall the depths used in the calculation exceed the actual depths at these points.


**15** Unless the owner of a lifeboat requires the cubic capacity of the lifeboat to be determined in accordance with section 12, the cubic capacity may be assumed to be that determined by using the formula
- **(a)** L x B x D x 0.6; or
- **(b)** in the case of lifeboats other than planked wooden lifeboats, L x B x D x 0.64;
where L is the length measured from the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post, or to the after side of the transom, and B is the greatest breadth at the outside of the planking and D is the depth amidships inside the planking from the keel to the level of the gunwale but in any case does not exceed 45 per cent of the breadth.


**16** The following table shows the dimensions and cubic capacity of standard lifeboats where the cubic capacity of a lifeboat is determined by using one of the formulae specified in section 15 of this Schedule:
