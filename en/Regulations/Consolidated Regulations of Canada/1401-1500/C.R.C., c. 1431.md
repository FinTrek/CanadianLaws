- **(4)** Wells for purposes other than drainage shall not be constructed in the double bottom; the Board may exempt any ship from the requirements of this subsection in respect of any well it is satisfied will not diminish the protection given by the double bottom.

- **(5)** Nothing in this section shall require a double bottom to be fitted in way of watertight compartments used exclusively for the carriage of liquids, if the safety of the ship will not be impaired in the event of bottom or side damage by reason of the absence of a double bottom in that position.

- **(6)** The Board may exempt any ship, other than a ship of Class I, from the requirements of a double bottom in any portion of the ship that is subdivided by application of a factor of subdivision not exceeding 0.5 if it is satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that portion of the ship would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.
> SOR/95-254, ss. 3, 32.





### Stability in Damaged Condition


**12** 

- **(1)** Every ship shall be so constructed as to provide sufficient intact stability in all service conditions to enable the ship to withstand the final flooding of any one of the main compartments into which the ship is subdivided in accordance with the provisions of section 9; if two of the main compartments, being adjacent to each other, are separated by a bulkhead that is stepped, the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the final flooding of those compartments; if the ship’s factor of subdivision is 0.5 or less, the intact stability shall be adequate to withstand the final flooding of any two of the main compartments that are adjacent to each other.

- **(2)** For the purposes of this section, the sufficiency of the intact stability of every such ship shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule II.

- **(3)** Every ship shall be so constructed as to keep unsymmetrical flooding when the ship is in a damaged condition at the minimum consistent with efficient arrangements; if cross-flooding fittings are provided in any such ship, the fittings and the maximum heel of the ship before equalization shall be such as will not endanger the safety of the ship.

- **(4)** Where the margin line may become submerged during the flooding assumed for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Schedule II, the construction of the ship shall be such as will enable the master of the ship to ensure
	- **(a)** that the maximum angle of heel during any stage of such flooding will not be such as will endanger the safety of the ship; and
	- **(b)** that the margin line will not be submerged in the final stage of flooding.

- **(5)** In every ship the owner shall provide a document for the use of the master of the ship containing information as to the use of any cross-flooding fittings provided in the ship.

### Standard of Subdivision


**24** 

- **(1)** Every Group A ship, whether or not specifically required by this section to meet at least a one-compartment standard of subdivision, shall be fitted with at least three transverse watertight bulkheads.

- **(2)** Every Group A ship shall be subdivided as follows:
	- **(a)** if carrying more than 49 passengers and not more than 400, it shall be so subdivided that with any one main compartment flooded, the margin line will not be submerged;
	- **(b)** if carrying more than 400 and not more than 600 passengers, it shall, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), be so subdivided that with the forepeak and the adjacent main compartment flooded, the margin line will not be submerged;
	- **(c)** if carrying more than 600 and not more than 800 passengers, it shall, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), be so subdivided that with any two adjacent main compartments flooded within at least 40 per cent of the ship’s length from the forward perpendicular, the margin line will not be submerged;
	- **(d)** if carrying more than 800 and not more than 1 000 passengers, it shall, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), be so subdivided that with any two adjacent compartments flooded within 60 per cent of the ship’s length from the forward perpendicular, the margin line will not be submerged; and
	- **(e)** if carrying more than 1 000 passengers, it shall be so subdivided by main transverse watertight bulkheads that with any two adjacent main compartments flooded, the margin line will not be submerged.

- **(3)** Every Group B ship
	- **(a)** that is not over 45.7 m in water line length shall be so subdivided by main transverse bulkheads that with any one main compartment flooded the margin line will not be submerged;
	- **(b)** that is over 45.7 m but not over 61 m in water line length shall, in addition to one compartment subdivision, be so subdivided that, with either of the peak compartments and its adjacent main compartment flooded, the margin line will not be submerged; and
	- **(c)** that is over 61 m in water line length shall be so subdivided by main transverse watertight bulkheads that with any two adjacent main compartments flooded, the margin line will not be submerged.
> SOR/95-254, s. 32.




**25** In making subdivision calculations, the volume shall be calculated to the margin line and the assumed average permeability of spaces shall be as follows:Machinery spaces 85

Tanks, chain lockers and spaces normally filled with cargo stores, mail or baggage, in the full load condition 60

All other spaces 95





**26** To be considered effective, watertight bulkheads abaft the collision bulkhead shall be spaced not less than 3.05 m plus three per cent of the load water line length, but in the case of ships of Group B this minimum spacing shall be applicable between peak bulkheads.
> SOR/95-254, s. 32.




**27** Watertight bulkheads shall not be stepped unless additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same measure of safety as that obtained by a plane bulkhead; where a ship can withstand flooding of the two adjacent compartments separated by a stepped bulkhead and no part of such bulkhead is nearer to either of the other bulkheads bounding the adjacent compartments than is permitted by section 26, the step will be acceptable.



**28** 

- **(1)** If watertight bulkheads are recessed, the recess shall be inboard from the ship’s side by at least one-fifth the beam amidships measured at right angles to the centre line at the level of the load water line; otherwise, the bulkhead shall comply with the requirements for a stepped bulkhead.

- **(2)** In the case of ships that operate solely on the Great Lakes, where the maximum moulded beam at the deck and at the load water line differ appreciably, the inboard damage penetration may be assumed at a mean position between that corresponding to one-fifth of the maximum moulded beam at the deck, measured inboard at the deck, and that corresponding to one-fifth the maximum moulded beam at the load water line measured inboard at the load water line.



**29** Where a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision.



**30** The requirements for double bottoms as specified in section 11 of Part I apply to the ships of this Part.



**31** The requirements for peak and machinery space bulkheads as specified in section 10 of Part I apply to ships to which this Part applies, except that the requirements for afterpeak bulkheads specified in subsection 10(2) apply only to ships over 150 tons, gross tonnage.



**32** The requirements for damaged stability calculations as set out in Schedule II shall apply to all ships required by this Part to have at least a one-compartment standard of subdivision.



**33** The requirements for shaft tunnels as specified in subsection 10(3) of Part I apply to ships in excess of 150 tons, gross tonnage, to which this Part applies.



**34** The requirements of sections 14 to 18 respecting
- **(a)** openings in watertight bulkheads,
- **(b)** means of closing openings in watertight bulkheads, etc.,
- **(c)** means of operating sliding watertight doors,
- **(d)** signals and communications for watertight doors, and
- **(e)** construction of watertight doors
apply to all ships to which this Part applies, except that, in the case of ships that are less than 150 tons, gross tonnage, that operate on the Great Lakes or on the sea coasts and that do not proceed more than 20 nautical miles from land, and in the case of all ships on inland waters, other than the Great Lakes, hinged watertight doors complying with subsection 15(3) and (4) may be permitted within accommodation and working spaces, if it is practical to keep such doors closed at all times except when actually being used for transit; in the case of those ships where an emergency generator is not required to be fitted, the requirements for two sources of power prescribed in subsection 16(6) of Part I need not be complied with.
> SOR/95-254, s. 32.




**35** The requirements for openings in shell plating below the margin line, as specified in section 19 of Part I apply to the ships to which this Part applies.



**36** The requirements for side and other openings above the margin line and for weather decks, as specified in sections 20 and 21 of Part I, apply to the ships to which this Part applies.




### Subdivision Load Line Certificates


**37** 

- **(1)** The provisions specified in subsection 22(3) of Part I relating to issuance of subdivision load line certificates shall apply to ships of Class VI and Class VII that are 150 tons, gross tonnage, or over to which this Part applies.

- **(2)** The requirements for marking of subdivision load lines as specified in subsection 22(2) of Part I shall apply to ships of Class VI and Class VII that are 150 tons, gross tonnage, or over, except that references in paragraph 22(2)(c) to “the disc” shall read “the disc or diamond”; ships of Class VI and Class VII that make voyages to the United States on the Great Lakes shall be marked in similar manner to that specified in paragraphs 22(2)(a) and (b).

- **(3)** Subdivision load line certificates will not be issued to ships of Class III, IV, VI or VII that are less than 150 tons, gross tonnage, nor shall such certificates be issued to any ship of Class V or Class VIII regardless of gross tonnage; in the case of such ships, a letter stating the maximum load draft at which the ship is permitted to operate will be issued; this letter shall be posted in the wheel house, under glass, adjacent to the inspection certificate.

### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(Sections 2, 9, 15 and 16)**
## Calculation of Maximum Length of Watertight Compartments

**DIVISION I** 


#### General

**1** For the purposes of this Schedule, except where otherwise specified,
- **(a)** all linear measurements shall be in metres;
- **(b)** all volumes shall be in cubic metres and shall be calculated from measurements taken to moulded lines;
- **(c)** the symbol “L” denotes the length of the ship;
- **(d)** the expression “passenger spaces” shall include galleys, laundries and other similar spaces provided for the service of passengers, in addition to space provided for the use of passengers; and
- **(e)** plans of the subdivision arrangements and calculations as follows shall be submitted:
	- **(i)** outline profile and plans showing the margin lines (corrected as necessary); all watertight transverse and longitudinal bulkheads, decks, inner skins, shaft and other tunnels, trunks and ventilators; recesses and steps in watertight bulkheads; double bottoms, the principal openings in the watertight bulkheads and decks and openings therein closed only by portable plates, the appropriation of spaces below the bulkhead deck; the positions of equivalent plane bulkheads; the lengths of the main transverse compartments and the weathertight arrangements at the forward end; tunnels, recesses and steps shall be shown in plan and elevation and typical sections of the double bottom shall be given, and
	- **(ii)** subdivision coefficients and particulars on forms BH2 and BH2A, calculations of equivalent plane bulkheads, allowances for local subdivision, flooding calculations and curves and the particulars required to enable the Board to determine whether a detailed calculation of permeability is required under clause 3(b)(i)(B) and paragraph 8(b).



#### Floodable and Permissible Lengths

**2** Subject to section 6 of this Schedule, the length of a compartment shall not exceed its permissible length; the permissible length of a compartment having its centre at any point shall be the product of the floodable length at that point and the factor of subdivision of the ship; to enable the permissible length of compartments to be determined, it will be necessary to develop flooding curves that will indicate the floodable length at any point in the ship; flooding curves should be developed by a method of calculation that takes account of the form, draught and other characteristics of the ship; the method described in Division IV of this Schedule should normally be used; if, however, the ship is of such unusual form that this method is not sufficiently accurate, the Board may permit the use of an alternative method of calculation.



**DIVISION II** 


#### All Ships Referred to in Section 8 of Part I Except Ships of Class II and Class III Specified in Division III of this Schedule

**3** The assumptions of permeability, which shall be taken into account in determining the floodable length at any point in ships to which this Division applies, shall be as follows:
- **(a)** machinery space:
	- **(i)** in the case of ships not propelled by internal combustion engines, the assumed average permeability throughout the machinery space shall be determined by the following formula:
```
80 + 12.5 ((a - c)) ÷ (v)
```
where
- **a** = volume of the passenger spaces and crew spaces below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space;
- **c** = volume of the between deck spaces below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space which are appropriated to cargo, coal or stores; and
- **v** = volume of the machinery space below the margin line,
	- **(ii)** in the case of ships propelled by internal combustion engines, the average permeability throughout the machinery space shall be taken as five greater than that given by the aforesaid formula, and
	- **(iii)** in any case in which the average permeability throughout the machinery space, as determined by detailed calculation, is less than that given by the aforesaid formula, the calculated value may be substituted; for the purposes of such calculation, the permeability of passenger spaces and crew spaces shall be taken to be 95, that of all spaces appropriated for cargo, coal or stores shall be taken to be 60, and that of double bottom, oil fuel and other tanks forming part of the structure of the ship shall be taken to be 95 or such lesser figure as the Board may approve in the case of that ship; and
- **(b)** portions before and abaft the machinery space:
	- **(i)** the assumed average permeability throughout the portions of the ship before and abaft the machinery space shall be determined:
		- **(A)** by the following formula:
```
63 + 35 (a) ÷ (v)
```
where
- **a** = volume of the passenger spaces and crew spaces which are situated below the margin line before or abaft the machinery space, as the case may be; and
- **v** = volume of the portion of the ship below the margin line before or abaft the machinery space, as the case may be, or
		- **(B)** if the Board so determines in the case of any ship, after receipt of a plan of the ship showing the watertight subdivisions thereof, by detailed calculation, for the purpose of which the permeability of spaces shall be assumed to be as follows:passenger spaces 95

crew spaces 95

spaces appropriated to machinery 80

spaces appropriated to cargo, coal, stores or baggage rooms 60

tanks forming part of the structure of the ship and double bottoms 95,

or such lesser figure as the Board may permit in the case of any ship; and




	- **(ii)** for the purposes of this section, a space within a passenger space or crew space shall be deemed to be a part thereof unless it is appropriated for other purposes and is enclosed by permanent steel bulkheads.



#### Factor of Subdivision

**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (4), in the case of ships the length of which is 131 m or more, the factor of subdivision F shall be determined by the following formula:
```
F = A - ((A - B) (<sub>s</sub> - 23)) ÷ (100)
```
where
- **A and B** are respectively determined in accordance with subsection (5) and C<sub>s</sub> is the criterion numeral determined in accordance with section 5 of this Schedule, provided that where in the case of any ship the factor F is less than 0.4 and the Board is satisfied that it is impracticable to apply the factor F in determining the permissible length of a compartment appropriated for machinery, the Board may allow an increased factor not exceeding 0.4 to be applied to that compartment.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (4), in the case of ships the length of which is less than 131 m but not less than 79 m having a criterion numeral of not less than
```
(3574 - 25L) ÷ (13)
```

(hereinafter in this section referred to as S), the factor of subdivision F shall be determined by the following formula:
```
F = 1 ((1 - B) (<sub>s</sub> - S)) ÷ (123 - S)
```
where
- **B** is the factor determined in accordance with subsection (5) and C<sub>s</sub> is the criterion numeral determined in accordance with section 5 of this Schedule.

- **(3)** In the case of ships the length of which is less than 131 m but not less than 79 m and having a criterion numeral less than S or in the case of ships the length of which is less than 79 m the factor of subdivision shall be unity.

- **(4)** In the case of a ship of any length which is intended to carry a number of passengers exceeding 12 but not exceeding
```
(()<sup>2</sup>) ÷ (650) or 50
```

whichever is the lower, the factor of subdivision shall be determined in the manner provided in subsection (3).

- **(5)** For the purposes of this subsection the factors A and B shall be determined by the following formulae:
```
A = (58.2) ÷ (L - 60) + 0.18 (where L = 131 and upwards)
```

```
B = (30.3) ÷ (L - 42) + 0.18 (where L = 79 and upwards).
```




#### Criterion of Service

**5** The criterion numeral for ships to which this Division applies shall be determined by the following formulae:When P<sub>1</sub> is greater than P


```
C<sub>s</sub> = 72 (M + 2<sub>1</sub>) ÷ (V + <sub>1</sub> - P)
```

and in all other cases
```
C<sub>s</sub> = 72 (M + 2P) ÷ (V)
```
where
- **C** <sub>s</sub>= the criterion numeral;
- **M** = the volume of the machinery space, with the addition thereto of the volume of any permanent oil fuel bunkers which may be situated above the inner bottom and before or abaft the machinery space;
- **P** = the volume of the passenger spaces and crew spaces below the margin line;
- **V** = the volume of the ship below the margin line;
- **N** = number of passengers which the ship is intended to carry; and
- **P** <sub>1</sub>= 0.056LN
provided that:
- **(a)** where the value of 0.056LN is greater than the sum of P and the whole volume of the passenger spaces above the margin line, the figure to be taken as P<sub>1</sub> shall be that sum or 0.037LN whichever is the greater;
- **(b)** values of C<sub>s</sub> less than 23 shall be taken as 23; and
- **(c)** values of C<sub>s</sub> greater than 123 shall be taken as 123.



#### Special Rules for Subdivision

**6** 

- **(1)** Compartments exceeding the permissible length:
	- **(a)** a compartment may exceed its permissible length provided that the combined length of each pair of adjacent compartments to which the compartment in question is common does not exceed either the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is the lesser;
	- **(b)** if one compartment of either of such pairs of adjacent compartments is situated inside the machinery space, and the other compartment thereof is situated outside the machinery space, the combined length of the two compartments shall be adjusted in accordance with the mean average permeability of the two portions of the ship in which the compartments are situated;
	- **(c)** where the lengths of two adjacent compartments are governed by different factors of subdivision, the combined length of the two compartments shall be determined proportionately; and
	- **(d)** where in any portion of a ship bulkheads required by these Regulations to be watertight are carried to a higher deck than in the remainder of the ship, separate margin lines may be used for calculating the floodable length of that portion of the ship, if
		- **(i)** the two compartments adjacent to the resulting step in the bulkhead deck are each within the permissible length corresponding to their respective margin lines and, in addition, their combined length does not exceed twice the permissible length determined by reference to the lower margin line of such compartments, and
		- **(ii)** the sides of the ship are extended throughout the ship’s length to the deck corresponding to the uppermost margin line and all openings in the shell plating below that deck throughout the length of the ship comply with the requirements of section 19 as if they were openings below the margin line.

#### Additional Subdivision at Forward End


- **(2)** In ships 131 m in length and upwards, the watertight bulkhead next abaft the collision bulkhead shall be fitted at a distance from the forward perpendicular that is not greater than the permissible length appropriate to a compartment bounded by the forward perpendicular and such bulkhead.

#### Steps in Bulkheads


- **(3)** If a bulkhead required by these Regulations to be watertight is stepped, it shall comply with one of the following conditions:
	- **(a)** in ships having a factor of subdivision not greater than 0.9, the combined length of the two compartments separated by such bulkhead shall not exceed 90 per cent of the floodable length or twice the permissible length, whichever is the lesser; in ships having a factor of subdivision greater than 0.9, the combined length of the two compartments shall not exceed the permissible length;
	- **(b)** additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same measure of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead; or
	- **(c)** the compartment over which the step extends does not exceed the permissible length corresponding to a margin line taken 76 mm below the step.

#### Recesses in Bulkheads


- **(4)** If any part of a recess lies outside vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one fifth of the breadth of the ship and measured at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load water line, the whole of such recess shall be deemed to be a step in a bulkhead for the purposes of subsection (3).

#### Equivalent Plane Bulkheads


- **(5)** Where a bulkhead required by these Regulations to be watertight is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be assumed in determining the subdivision.

#### Minimum Spacing of Bulkheads


- **(6)** If the distance between two adjacent bulkheads required by these Regulations to be watertight, or their equivalent plane bulkheads, or the distance between transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped portions of the bulkheads, is less than 0.03L + 3.05 m, or 10.67 m, or 0.1L, whichever is the least, only one of those bulkheads shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship; for Class V and Class VIII vessels, this minimum spacing shall be applicable between peak bulkheads.

#### Allowance for Local Subdivision


- **(7)** Where in any ship a main transverse watertight compartment contains local subdivision and the Board is satisfied that, after any assumed side damage extending over a length of 0.03L + 3.05 m, or 10.67 m, or 0.1L, whichever is the least, the whole volume of the main compartment will not be flooded, a proportionate allowance may be made in the permissible length otherwise required for such compartment; in such a case the volume of effective buoyancy assumed on the undamaged side shall not be greater than that assumed on the damaged side.



**DIVISION III** 
### Ships of Class II and Class III to which Section 8 of Part I Applies That Are Permitted by the Board, in Exercise of its Power under Subsection 7(6) of the Life Saving Equipment Regulations to Carry Persons in Excess of the Lifeboat Capacity Provided on Board


#### General Rules for Subdivision

**7** Subject to the modifications set forth in this Division, the maximum length of compartments in ships to which this Division applies shall be determined as if they were ships to which Division II applies.



#### Assumption of Permeability in Portions Before and Abaft the Machinery Space

**8** In ships to which this Division applies, the assumed average permeability throughout the portions of the ship before and abaft the machinery space shall be determined
- **(a)** by the following formula:
```
95 - 35(b) ÷ (v)
```
where
- **b =** the volume of the spaces that are situated below the margin line before or abaft the machinery space, as the case may be, and above the tops of floors, inner bottom, or peak tanks, and which are appropriated for use as coal or oil fuel bunkers, store rooms, baggage rooms, mail rooms, chain lockers or fresh water tanks and of spaces appropriated for cargo if the Board is satisfied the greater part of the volume of the space is intended to be occupied by cargo; and
- **v =** v =the volume of the portion of the ship below the margin line before or abaft the machinery space, as the case may be; or
- **(b)** if the Board so determines in the case of any ship, after receipt of a plan of the ship showing the watertight subdivision thereof, by detailed calculation, for the purpose of which the permeability of spaces shall be assumed to be as follows:passenger spaces 95

crew spaces 95

spaces appropriated to machinery 80

spaces appropriated to bunker coal, stores or baggage rooms 60

spaces appropriated to cargo, tanks forming part of the structure of the ship and double bottoms 95,

or such lesser figure as the Board may permit in the case of any ship.







#### Factor of Subdivision

**9** 

- **(1)** Subject to this section, the factor of subdivision of ships to which this Division applies shall be the factor determined in the manner provided in section 4 of this Schedule, or 0.5 whichever is the lesser, provided that if the Board is satisfied in the case of any ship, the length of which is less than 91.5 m, that it is impracticable to apply that factor to any compartment it may allow a higher factor to be applied to that compartment.

- **(2)** If in the case of any ship to which this Division applies the Board is satisfied that the quantity of cargo to be carried in the ship will be such as to render impracticable the application abaft the collision bulkhead of a factor of subdivision not exceeding 0.5, the factor of subdivision of the ship shall be determined as follows:
	- **(a)** in the case of ships the length of which is 131 m and upwards, by the formula:
```
F = A - ((A - BB) (<sub>s</sub> - 23)) ÷ (100)
```

#### General Description of Method

**12** 
- **(a)** In determining the floodable length, a uniform average permeability shall be used throughout the whole length of each of the following portions of the ship below the margin line :
	- **(i)** the machinery space,
	- **(ii)** the portion forward of the machinery space, and
	- **(iii)** the portion abaft the machinery space;
- **(b)** the assumptions of permeability appropriate to each Class of ship, which shall be taken into account for each of the above portions of the ship, are laid down in sections 3 and 8 of this Schedule;
- **(c)** for a given ship, therefore, three flooding curves must in general be drawn more or less completely, corresponding to the three different permeabilities, the significant part of each curve depending on the position of the bulkheads bounding the machinery space;
- **(d)** the size and shape of a flooding curve depend principally on the freeboard ratio and on the assumed permeability; they depend, also, to a smaller extent, on the character of the lines of the vessel and on the sheer of the margin lines forward and aft; using the same vertical and horizontal scales for percentage of length, the ends of a flooding curve terminate on straight lines drawn through points in the base line representing the position of the fore and after perpendiculars, at an angle θ, where tan θ = 2; these lines are called the forward and after terminals respectively;
- **(e)** in order to determine curves of floodable length for any ship the Standard Diagrams should be used; these give floodable lengths (for the two permeabilities 60 per cent and 100 per cent), for a definite standard family of ship forms of differing block coefficients, freeboard ratios and sheer ratios; the floodable lengths obtained are in every case to be set off at right angles to the base line of the floodable length curve; for the two permeabilities mentioned, the curves of floodable length for any vessel of the standard form can be obtained directly from the cross curves given in the Plates, by the method indicated on Plate II; while for any other permeability the appropriate curve may be obtained (including terminal points) as follows:if 1<sub>1</sub> be the floodable length at the point considered for permeability 100 per cent and 1<sub>2</sub> be the floodable length at the point considered for permeability 60 per cent then the floodable length 1<sub>3</sub> at that point for a permeability µ will be given by


```
1<sub>3</sub> = 1<sub>1</sub> + (3) ÷ (2) (1<sub>2</sub> - 1<sub>1</sub>) ((100) ÷ (µ) - 1)
```

- **(f)** a convenient method of arranging the work to obtain the required curves is indicated in Specimen 2;
- **(g)** if the ship under consideration conforms to standard type, that is to say, if the coefficients (see Specimen 1) agree with those given on Plates XXVI and XXVII for the standard form, the floodable length curve determined as above will hold good for the ship; if, however, there are differences in these respects, the curve obtained as above should be modified as follows:let A, Fig. 1, mark the fore-and-aft position of the centre of flotation of mean waterplane of the standard form, and A<sub>1</sub>, that of the corresponding point for the ship under consideration, the horizontal distance between them being mL; take any point P on the standard form curve, distant χ from A, the ratio
```
((χ) ÷ (L))
```


being represented by p, so that the value of p varies according to the position of P; the longitudinal position of the point P<sub>1</sub>, on the new curve, corresponding to the point P on the old, is given by
```
χ<sub>1</sub> = χ × (<sub>1</sub>) ÷ (n) × (a) ÷ (<sub>1</sub>) ÷ (1 ± m (ap) ÷ (n))
```


where n and n<sub>1</sub> are the moment of inertia coefficients of the mean water plane of the standard form and the new form respectively; the length of the ordinate M<sub>1</sub> p<sub>1</sub> is given by
```
M<sub>1</sub> P<sub>1</sub> = MP × (<sub>1</sub>) ÷ (a) x (ß) ÷ (<sub>1</sub>) x (1 ± m (ap) ÷ (n))
```


where a and a<sub>1</sub> are the area coefficients of the mean water planes of the standard form and the new form respectively and ß and ß<sub>1</sub> are the sectional area coefficients of the standard form and the new form respectively at MP and M<sub>1</sub>P<sub>1</sub>; the sign to be used in the last factor of the above expressions will be + when the centre of flotation of the mean water plane of the new form is *before*, and - when it is *abaft*, that of the standard form for sections forward of the centre of flotation, and the opposite sign for sections abaft the centre of flotation; this work may be conveniently arranged as in Specimen 3;

GRAPHIC IS NOT DISPLAYED, SEE C.R.C., C. 1431, P. 12150 AND 12151


- **(h)** the coefficients required for a new ship may be conveniently recorded as indicated in Specimen 1, while the similar information for standard form is given on Plates XXVI and XXVII;
- **(i)** it may be noted that, if the longitudinal position of the centre of flotation of mean water plane does not materially differ from that of the corresponding standard form, the factor
```
(1 ± m (ap) ÷ (n))
```
may without material error be omitted for both length of ordinate and its position;


- **(j)** the curves of permissible length are obtained from the curve of floodable length by using the appropriate factor of subdivision and it will be noted that these curves will not extend at the ends of the terminal lines; they can, however, be drawn in when required with sufficient accuracy, by means of the construction shown in Fig. 2; make A B = 2 A D, and B C = 4 D E, A being the lowest point of the curve of permissible length, and A B horizontal; then a fair curve may be drawn through A E C to meet the terminal line as shown in the diagram.

### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(Sections 12 and 32)**
## Stability in Damaged Condition

### Calculations of Stability in Damaged Condition

**1** The sufficiency of intact stability of every ship to which Part I of these Regulations applies shall be determined by calculation, which has regard to the design and construction of the ship and the damaged compartments and is in accordance with the following assumptions:
- **(a)** the ship shall be assumed to be in the worst condition as regards stability that is likely to be experienced having regard to the intended service of the ship;
- **(b)** the volume permeabilities and surface permeabilities shall be assumed to be as follows:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Spaces</th>
<th>Permeability</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Appropriated to cargo, coal or stores</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Appropriated to accommodation for passengers and crew</td>
<td>95</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Appropriated to machinery</td>
<td>85</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Appropriated to liquids</td>
<td>0 or 95, whichever results in the more onerous requirements;</td>
</tr>
</table>

- **(c)** the minimum extent of damage shall be assumed to be as follows:
	- **(i)** longitudinal extent: 3.05 m plus 3 per cent of the length of the ship, or 10.67 m, or 10 per cent of the length of the ship, whichever is the least,
	- **(ii)** transverse extent: 20 per cent of the breadth of the ship (measured inboard from the ship’s side at right angles to the centre line at the level of the deepest subdivision load water line),
	- **(iii)** vertical extent: from the top of the double bottom up to the margin line,
	- **(iv)** if any damage of lesser extent than that indicated in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) would result in a more severe condition regarding heel or loss of metacentric height, such damage shall be assumed for the purposes of the calculation;
- **(d)** where the ship is fitted with decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads of sufficient tightness to restrict the flow of water, regard shall be had to such restrictions in the calculation.



### Sufficiency of Stability in Damaged Condition

**2** The intact stability of the ship shall be deemed to be sufficient if the calculation mentioned in section 1 shows that, after the assumed damage and after equalization measures have been taken, the final condition of the ship is as follows:
- **(a)** in the event of unsymmetrical flooding, the metacentric height is positive;
- **(b)** in the event of unsymmetrical flooding, the heel does not exceed seven degrees, except that in special cases the Board may allow additional heel, but in no case shall the final heel exceed 15 degrees; and
- **(c)** in the event of unsymmetrical flooding, the margin line is not submerged.


**3** Automatic equalization measures are preferable and complete details in this regard shall be submitted with the calculations; all pipes concerned shall be of suitable area to permit rapid counter flooding; where air and filling or overflow pipes are led to a common main, care shall be taken that in the event of damage there is no leakage to intact compartments through these or any other pipes.
