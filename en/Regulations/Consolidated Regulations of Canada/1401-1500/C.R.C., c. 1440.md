## Correction for Type B Ships

**20** The basic freeboard for a Type B ship of less than 152.4 mm in length, having enclosed superstructures with an effective length (E) of up to 25 per cent of the length (L) of the ship, shall be increased by 2.5 (152.4 - L) (0.25 - E/L), expressed in millimetres.







## Correction for Superstructures and Trunks

**21** 

- **(1)** Where the sum of the effective lengths (E) of the enclosed superstructure equals 1.0 L, the basic freeboard shall be reduced by Hs × 500 expressed in millimetres.

- **(2)** Where the sum of the effective lengths (E) of enclosed superstructures and the effective lengths (E) of efficient trunks is less than 1.0 L, the basic freeboard shall be reduced by (E/2 L) (1 + E/L) (Hs × 500) expressed in millimetres.







## Correction for Sheer

**22** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (4) to (7), the sheer profile of a ship is the line of the freeboard deck at side.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), the sheer of a ship shall be measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to
	- **(a)** the keel through the sheer line at amidship; or
	- **(b)** in a ship designed with a rake of keel, the design load waterline.

- **(3)** In a ship with a step or break in the topsides, the line of reference shall be drawn through the point amidships that represents the upper point of the mean depth of the ship.

- **(4)** Subject to subsection (5), in a ship with an enclosed superstructure of at least standard height (Hs) that extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer profile is the line of the superstructure deck at side.

- **(5)** Where the height of the superstructure referred to in subsection (4) exceeds Hs, the sheer of the ship at
	- **(a)** the after and the forward perpendiculars shall be deemed to be increased by Z, being the least difference between Hs and the height of the superstructure,
	- **(b)** 1/6 L from each perpendicular shall be deemed to be increased by 0.444 Z, and
	- **(c)** 1/3 L from each perpendicular shall be deemed to be increased by 0.111 Z,
and the sheer profile shall be deemed to be correspondingly altered.

- **(6)** Where the deck of an enclosed superstructure has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck shall not be taken into account.

- **(7)** Where an enclosed poop or forecastle is of standard height (Hs) and has greater sheer than that of the freeboard deck, or where the height of an enclosed poop or forecastle exceeds Hs, the sheer of the ship shall be deemed to be increased by the amount obtained from the following formula and the sheer profile shall be deemed to be correspondingly altered:
```
y/3 × L′/L,
```
where
- **y** = the difference between Hs and the height of the poop or forecastle at either perpendicular; and
- **L′** = the mean length of the poop or forecastle or 0.5L, whichever is lesser.

- **(8)** The ordinates of the standard sheer profile for a station described in Column I of an item of the table to this section are set out in Column II of that item.

- **(9)** Where the sheer profile of a ship differs from the standard sheer profile,
	- **(a)** the excess or deficiency of sheer in each half of the ship is calculated as follows:
		- **(i)** the ordinates of the sheer profile for each station described in Column I of an item of the table to this section shall be multiplied by the factor set out in Column III of that item and the sum of the four products for each half of the ship shall be calculated,
		- **(ii)** the ordinates of the standard sheer profile for each station described in Column I of an item of the table to this section shall be multiplied by the factor set out in Column III of that item and the sum of the four products for each half of the ship shall be calculated,
		- **(iii)** the sum described in subparagraph (ii) for the forward half of the ship shall be subtracted from the sum described in subparagraph (i) for the forward half of the ship,
		- **(iv)** the sum described in subparagraph (ii) for the after half of the ship shall be subtracted from the sum described in subparagraph (i) for the after half of the ship,
		- **(v)** the excess of sheer in each half of the ship is the positive figure, divided by eight, calculated for that half pursuant to subparagraph (iii) or (iv), as the case may be, and
		- **(vi)** the deficiency of sheer in each half of the ship is the negative figure, divided by eight, calculated for that half pursuant to subparagraph (iii) or (iv), as the case may be; and
	- **(b)** subject to subsections (10) and (11), the excess or deficiency of sheer for the ship is the positive or negative arithmetical mean, whichever is appropriate, of the excess or deficiency in both halves of the ship.

- **(10)** Where the sheer in the after half of a ship exceeds the standard and the sheer in the forward half is less than the standard, no credit shall be given for the excess of sheer and the deficiency of sheer only shall be measured.

- **(11)** Where the sheer in the forward half of a ship exceeds the standard,
	- **(a)** credit shall be given for the excess, if the sheer in the after half is not less than 75 per cent of the standard;
	- **(b)** no credit shall be given for the excess, if the sheer in the after half is less than 50 per cent of the standard; and
	- **(c)** intermediate credit shall be given for the excess, if the sheer in the after half is between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the standard.

### Corrections for Variations from Standard Sheer


- **(12)** The correction for sheer in a ship shall be the excess or deficiency of sheer referred to in subsections (9) to (11) multiplied by
```
[0.75 - (S / 2 L)]
```
where
- **S** is the total length of enclosed superstructures.

### Addition for Deficiency of Sheer


- **(13)** Where the sheer of a ship is less than the standard, the correction for deficiency of sheer, calculated in accordance with subsection (12), shall be added to the freeboard.

### Deduction for Excess of Sheer


- **(14)** Where the sheer of a ship exceeds the standard, the deduction from freeboard shall be as follows:
	- **(a)** where an enclosed superstructure covers 0.1 L before and 0.1 L abaft amidships, the deduction shall be equal to the correction for excess of sheer, calculated in accordance with subsection (12);
	- **(b)** where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no deduction shall be made; and
	- **(c)** where an enclosed superstructure covers less than 0.1 L before and 0.1 L abaft amidships, the deduction shall be calculated by linear interpolation.

- **(15)** No reduction of the basic freeboard, pursuant to subsection (14), that exceeds 125 mm per 100 m of length (L) shall be made.







## Correction for Bow Height

	- **(c)** 49.417 L (1 - L/500) millimetres, in the case of a ship of less than 167.6 m in length, or
	- **(d)** 8677-18.917 L millimetres, in the case of a ship of 167.6 m or more in length,
the basic freeboard shall be increased by the difference between the ship’s bow height and the bow height described in paragraphs (c) and (d).

- **(2)** Where the ship’s bow height includes sheer and that sheer does not extend for at least 15 per cent of the length of the ship measured from the forward perpendicular, the ship’s bow height shall be deemed to be its actual bow height minus the amount of that sheer.

- **(3)** Where the ship’s bow height includes the height of a superstructure and that superstructure
	- **(a)** does not extend from the stem to a point at least 0.06 L abaft the forward perpendicular,
	- **(b)** in the case of a ship not over 152.4 m in length, is not an enclosed superstructure, and
	- **(c)** in the case of a ship of over 152.4 m in length, is not fitted with closing appliances to the satisfaction of the Assigning Authority,
the ship’s bow height shall be deemed to be its actual bow height minus the height of that superstructure.







## Correction for Deck Line

**24** 

- **(1)** Where the actual depth, measured from the same point as for moulded depth to the point where the upper edge of the deck line is to be placed, is greater than D, the difference between the two depths shall be added to the basic freeboard.
