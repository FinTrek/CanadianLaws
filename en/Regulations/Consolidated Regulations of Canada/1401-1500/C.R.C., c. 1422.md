### Special Requirements for Cargo Spaces, Pump Rooms, Store Rooms, Lamp Rooms, Paint Lockers and Similar Spaces

**5**

### Special Requirements for Boiler and Machinery Spaces

**6** 

- **(1)** Coamings shall be fitted in the machinery spaces, where boilers are oil fired, in order to prevent the spread of oil in case of a leak.

- **(4.1)** Where the bulkheads specified in subsection (4) are not provided, the boundary of the space shall be fitted with screens so as to retard the disposal of the steam, which screens shall be not less than 760 mm in height and may, where suitable, be an extension upwards of the coamings provided to prevent the spread of the oil.

- **(5)** Where drains are fitted to boiler flats they shall be led to a safe place, such as an oily bilge.



### Smothering Gas Installations as Alternative Means

**7**

- **(3)** Means shall be provided in all ships to close openings which would admit air to the machinery spaces, or any space in which there is a risk of an oil fire.

- **(4)** When smothering gas or steam is provided for oil-fired boiler spaces, means shall be provided for closing the annular spaces around the funnels; the means for closing these openings shall be arranged so that they will not be readily cut off from use by an outbreak of fire; where, however, CO<sub>2</sub> is provided as the smothering medium and it is not practicable to close the annular spaces around the funnels, this requirement may be dispensed with if sufficient gas is available to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 40 per cent of the total volume of the space.

		- **(ii)** in other spaces, at between 57°C and 82°C;
	- **(c)** at least six spare sprinkler heads which shall be stowed in clearly identified boxes or holders provided for that purpose near the control valve for the section;
	- **(d)** the sprinkler heads so designed and arranged that the overhead is effectively protected and that all portions of the deck below are covered;
	- **(e)** the sprinklers so located that no part of the overhead or vertical projection of the deck below is more than 2 m from a sprinkler head; and
	- **(f)** the sprinkler heads placed as clear as possible, of beams, or other objects likely to obstruct the projection of water.

- **(6)** Sprinkler heads shall not be located in radio rooms.



#### Alarms

**23** 

- **(1)** Each wet or dry automatic sprinkler system shall include means for giving a visible and audible alarm signal automatically whenever any sprinkler comes into operation.

- **(2)** The alarm signal referred to in subsection (1)
	- **(a)** shall indicate on a panel at one or more points on the ship, so as to bring rapidly to the attention of the master and the crew, the presence and position of any fire in the spaces served by the system; and
	- **(b)** if the alarm is operated electrically, it shall be constructed so as to operate if any derangement occurs in the electrical circuit.


**24** A framed block plan shall be fixed in close proximity to the indicator panel prescribed in section 23 and shall show the parts of the ship protected by each sectional or installation control valve and the situation thereof.



#### Power Supply

**25** 

- **(1)** Safety Convention ships shall be provided with not less than two sources of power supply for the sea water pumps, air compressors and automatic alarms.

- **(2)** Where the sources of power are electrical,
	- **(a)** there shall be a main generator and an emergency source of power;
	- **(b)** one supply of power shall be taken from the main switch board by separate feeders reserved solely for that purpose;
	- **(c)** the feeders shall be run to a change-over switch situated near the sprinkler unit;
	- **(d)** the change-over switch from the emergency switchboard to the feeder shall normally be kept closed;
	- **(e)** the change-over switch shall be clearly labelled; and
	- **(f)** no other switch shall be permitted in those feeders.



#### Aluminum Alloy Superstructures

**26** Where the superstructure of a passenger ship carrying more than 12 passengers is constructed of aluminum alloy and Method II of fire protection is employed in accordance with the [Hull Construction Regulations](/en/Regulations/Consolidated%20Regulations%20of%20Canada/1401-1500/C.R.C.,%20c.%201431.md), the whole unit including the sprinkler pump, tank and air compressor shall be situated, to the satisfaction of the Board, in a position reasonably remote from the boilers and machinery spaces, and, if the feeders from the emergency generator to the sprinkler unit pass through any space constituting a fire risk, the cables shall be of a fireproof type.



#### Testing

**27** Sprinkler systems shall, for testing purposes, have
- **(a)** a test valve situated near the control valve for each section for testing the automatic alarm for that section of sprinklers by a discharge of water equivalent to the operation of one sprinkler head;
- **(b)** means for testing the automatic cutting-in of the pump; and
- **(c)** switches at one of the points referred to in section 23 that will enable the alarm and the indicators for each section of sprinklers to be tested.



#### Instruction Book

**28** An instruction book regarding the operation and maintenance of the sprinkler equipment, containing a block plan and appendix showing the parts of the ship protected by the various control valves, shall be carried in the ship.

### **SCHEDULE VII** 
**(s. 19)**
## Precautions To Be Taken Against Fire in Small Motor Ships
**1** Care must be taken to prevent leakage of gasoline, or the risk of fire due to unshielded woodwork or other flammable material being in too close proximity to hot pipes.


**2** Where a reserve supply of gasoline is carried it shall be carried in a metal container and the spout or opening in the container shall be provided with an effective cap.


**3** In all cases when gasoline tanks are being filled, an efficient funnel shall be used to prevent spillage into the hull of the boat.


**4** Gasoline tanks shall be installed so that gasoline cannot spill into the bilges while the tanks are being filled.


**5** Passenger vessels using gasoline shall not be fueled while passengers are on board.


**6** An appliance which burns liquid or gaseous fuel shall be so fitted that there is a free circulation of air all around and below the appliance.
