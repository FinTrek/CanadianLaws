**1** For distances greater than 8 m the standard void depth Vd<sub>1</sub> shall be linearly extrapolated at 80 mm increase for each 1 m increase in distance.

**2** Where there is a difference in depth between the hatchside girder or its continuation and the hatchend beam, the greater depth shall be used except that:

(a) when the hatchside girder or its continuation is shallower than the hatchend beam, the voids abreast the hatchway may be calculated using the lesser depth;



(b) when the hatchend beam is shallower than the hatchside girder or its continuation, the voids fore and aft of the hatchway inboard of the continuation of the hatchside girder may be calculated using the lesser depth; and



(c) where there is a raised deck clear of a hatchway, the average void depth measured from the underside of the raised deck shall be calculated using the standard void depth in association with a girder depth of the hatchend beam plus the height of the raised deck.

- **(1)** For the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the stability criteria in subsection 6(1) of these Regulations (see Figure 1), the ship's stability calculations shall be normally based upon the assumption that the centre of gravity of cargo in a filled compartment is at the volumetric centre of the whole cargo space.

- **(2)** Where the Administration authorizes account to be taken of the effect of assumed underdeck voids on the vertical taken of the effect of assumed underdeck voids on the vertical position of the centre of gravity of the cargo in filled compartments, the adverse effect of the vertical shift of grain surfaces shall be compensated for by increasing the assumed heeling moment due to the transverse shift of grain as follows:total heeling moment = 1.06 × calculated transverse heeling moment.



- **(3)** In all cases the weight of cargo in a filled compartment shall be the volume of the whole cargo space divided by the stowage factor.

- **(4)** In partly filled compartments the adverse effect of the vertical shift of grain surfaces shall be taken into account as follows:total heeling moment = 1.12 × calculated transverse heeling moment.



- **(5)** Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (4), any method, other than that set out therein, that is equally effective, may be adopted to make the compensation required by those subsections.GRAPHIC IS NOT DISPLAYED, SEE C.R.C., C. 1427, P. 12037

**PART II** 
## Assumed Volumetric Heeling Moment of a Filled Compartment




## General

**3** 

- **(1)** The pattern of grain surface movement relates to a transverse section across the portion of the compartment being considered and the resultant heeling moment should be multiplied by the length to obtain the total moment for that portion.

- **(2)** The assumed transverse heeling moment due to grain shifting is a consequence of final changes of shape and position of voids after grain has moved from the high side to the low side.

- **(3)** The resulting grain surface after shifting shall be assumed to be at 15 degrees to the horizontal.

- **(4)** In calculating the maximum void area that can be formed against a longitudinal structural member, the effects of any horizontal surfaces, such as flanges or face bars, shall be ignored.

- **(5)** The total areas of the initial and final voids shall be equal.

- **(6)** A discontinuous longitudinal division shall be considered effective over its full length.







## Assumptions

**4** In this section it is assumed that the total heeling moment for a compartment is obtained by adding the results of separate considerations of the following portions:
- **(a)** for before and abaft hatchways,
	- **(i)** if a compartment has two or more main hatchways through which loading may take place, the depth of the underdeck void for every portion between such hatchways shall be determined using the fore and aft distance to the midpoint between the hatchways, and
	- **(ii)** after the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be assumed to be as shown in Figure 2 to this section; and
- **(b)** for in and abreast hatchways, after the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern shall be assumed to be as shown in Figure 3 or Figure 4, whichever is applicable.GRAPHIC IS NOT DISPLAYED, SEE C.R.C., C. 1427, P. 12039

FIGURE 2

Notes on Figure 2 :

**1** If the maximum void area that can be formed against the girder at B is less than the initial area of the void under AB, i.e. AB × Vd, the excess area shall be assumed to transfer to the final void on the high side.

**2** If the longitudinal division at C is one that has been provided in accordance with section 7 of these Regulations, it shall extend to at least 0.6 m below D or E, whichever gives the greater depth.

FIGURE 3

Notes on Figure 3 :

**1** AB Any area in excess of the area that can be formed against the girder at B shall be transferred to the final void area in the hatchway.

**2** CD Any area in excess of the area that can be formed against the girder at E shall be transferred to the final void area on the high side.

FIGURE 4

Notes on Figure 4 :

**1** If the centreline division is one that has been provided in accordance with paragraph 7(2)(b) of these Regulations, it shall extend to at least 0.6 m below H or J, whichever gives the greater depth.

**2** The excess void area from AB shall transfer to the low side half of the hatchway in which two separate final void areas will be formed as follows: one against the centreline division and the other against the hatchside coaming and girder on the high side.

**3** If a bagged saucer or bulk bundle is formed in a hatchway it shall be assumed, for the purpose of calculating transverse heeling moment, that such a device is at least equivalent to the centreline division.









## Compartments Loaded in Combination

**5** The following paragraphs describe the pattern of void behaviour that shall be assumed when compartments are loaded in combination:
- **(a)** for compartments without effective centreline divisions
	- **(i)** under the upper deck, the same assumption as for the single deck arrangement described in section 4 of this Schedule,
	- **(ii)** under the second deck, the area of void available for transfer from the low side, i.e. the original void area less the area against the hatchside girder, shall be assumed to transfer as follows:
		- **(A)** one-half to the upper deck hatchway, and
		- **(B)** one-quarter each to the high side under the upper and second deck, and
	- **(iii)** under the third and lower decks, the void areas available for transfer from the low side of each of these decks shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to all the voids under the decks on the high side and the void in the upper deck hatchway;
- **(b)** for compartments with effective centreline divisions that extend into the upper deck hatchway,
	- **(i)** at all deck levels abreast the division the void areas available for transfer from the low side shall be assumed to transfer to the void under the low side half of the upper deck hatchway,
	- **(ii)** at the deck level immediately below the bottom of the division the void area available for transfer from the low side shall be assumed to transfer as follows:
		- **(A)** one-half to the void under the low side half of the upper deck hatchway, and
		- **(B)** the remainder in equal quantities to the voids under the decks on the high side, and
	- **(iii)** at deck levels lower than those described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), the void area available for transfer from the low side of each of those decks shall be assumed to transfer in equal quantities to the voids in each of the two halves of the upper deck hatchway on each side of the division and the voids under the decks on the high side; and
- **(c)** for compartments with effective centreline divisions that do not extend into the upper deck hatchway, since no horizontal transfer of voids may be assumed to take place at the same deck level as the division, the void area available for transfer from the low side at this level shall be assumed to transfer above the division to voids on the high sides in accordance with the principles of paragraphs (a) and (b).









**PART III** 
## Assumed Volumetric Heeling Moment of Feeders and Trunks




## Suitably Placed Wing Feeders

**6** It may be assumed that under the influence of ship motion underdeck voids will be substantially filled by the flow of grain from a pair of longitudinal feeders as shown in Figure 5, if
- **(a)** the feeders extend the full length of the deck and the perforations therein are adequately spaced; and
- **(b)** the volume of each feeder is equal to the volume of the underdeck void outboard of the hatchside girder and its continuation.GRAPHIC IS NOT DISPLAYED, SEE C.R.C., C. 1427, P. 12043

FIGURE 5



### Trunks Situated Over Main Hatchways



**7** After the assumed shift of grain the final void pattern in trunks situated over main hatchways shall be assumed to be as shown in Figure 6.GRAPHIC IS NOT DISPLAYED, SEE C.R.C., C. 1427, P. 12044

FIGURE 6

Notes on Figure 6:



**1** If the wing spaces in way of the trunk cannot be properly trimmed in accordance with section 5, it shall be assumed that a 25 degree surface shift takes place.













**PART IV** 
## Assumed Volumetric Heeling Moment of Partly Filled Compartments




## General

**8** Where the free surface of the bulk grain has not been secured in accordance with subsection 8(1) of these Regulations, it shall be assumed that the grain surface after shifting shall be at 25 degrees to the horizontal.







## Discontinuous Longitudinal Divisions

**9** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), in a compartment in which the longitudinal divisions between the transverse boundaries are not continuous, the length over which any such divisions are effective as devices to prevent full width shifts of grain surfaces shall be taken to be the actual length of the portion of the division under consideration less two-sevenths of the greater of the transverse distances between the division and its adjacent division or the ship's side.

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply in the lower compartments of any combination loading in which the upper compartment is either a filled compartment or a partly filled compartment.

### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(ss. 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 and 17)**

**PART I** 
## Strength of Grain Fittings




## General

**1** 

- **(1)** All timber used for the purpose of grain fittings shall be of good sound quality and of a type and grade that has been proved to be satisfactory for that purpose.

- **(2)** The actual finished dimensions of the timber used for grain fittings shall be in accordance with the dimensions specified in this Schedule.

- **(3)** Plywood of an exterior type bonded with waterproof glue and fitted so that the direction of the grain in the face plies is perpendicular to the supporting uprights or binder may be used for grain fittings if its strength is equivalent to that of solid timber of the appropriate scantlings.


**2** In calculating the dimensions of divisions loaded on one side, using Tables I and II to section 12 of this Schedule, the following working stresses should be adopted:For divisions of steel ____________ 2000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (196.13 MPa)

For divisions of wood ____________ 160 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (15.69 MPa)




**3** Materials other than wood or steel may be approved for such divisions if their mechanical properties are taken into account.


**4** 

- **(1)** Unless means are provided to prevent the ends of uprights being dislodged from their sockets, the depth of housing at each end of each upright shall be not less than 75 mm.

- **(2)** If an upright is not secured at the top, the uppermost shore or stay shall be fitted as near thereto as is practicable.

- **(3)** The arrangements provided for inserting shifting boards by removing a part of the cross-section of an upright shall be such that the local level of stresses is not unduly high.

- **(4)** Subject to subsection (5), the maximum bending moment imposed upon an upright supporting a division loaded on one side shall normally be calculated assuming that the ends of the uprights are freely supported.

- **(5)** If an Administration is satisfied that any degree of fixity assumed will be achieved in practice, account may be taken of any reduction in the maximum bending moment arising from any degree of fixity provided at the ends of the upright.


**5** Where uprights, binders or any other strength members are formed by two separate sections, one fitted on each side of a division and inter-connected by through bolts at adequate spacing, the effective section modules shall be taken as the sum of the two moduli of the separate sections.


**6** Where divisions do not extend to the full depth of the hold, such divisions and their uprights shall be supported or stayed so as to be as efficient as those that do extend to the full depth of the hold.

```
W<sub>1</sub> = 14.8 (h<sub>1</sub> - 1.2) cm<sup>3</sup>/m
```
 where:
- **h** <sub>1</sub>is the vertical unsupported span in metres and shall be taken as the maximum value of the distance between any two adjacent stays or between the stay or either end of the upright.Where this distance is less than 2.4 m the respective modulus shall be calculated as if the actual value was 2.4 m.



- **(2)** The moduli of wood uprights shall be determined by multiplying by 12.5 the corresponding moduli for steel uprights.

- **(3)** The moduli of uprights made of materials other than steel or wood shall be at least that required for steel increased in proportion to the ratio of the permissible stresses for steel to that of the material used and in such cases attention shall be paid also to the relative rigidity of each upright to ensure that the deflection is not excessive.

- **(4)** The horizontal distance between uprights shall be such that the unsupported spans of the shifting boards do not exceed the maximum span specified in subsection 7(2) of this Schedule.

For other values of h or L the reaction loads shall be determined by linear interpolation or extrapolation as necessary.



- **(3)** The strength of the end connections of such vertical members or uprights may be calculated on the basis of the maximum load likely to be imposed at either end, as follows:Longitudinal Divisions:

Maximum load at the top ____________ 50% of the appropriate total load from Table I

Maximum Load at the bottom ____________ 55% of the appropriate total load from Table I

Transverse Divisions:

Maximum load at the top ____________ 45% of the appropriate total load from Table II

Maximum load at the bottom ____________ 60% of the appropriate total load from Table II



- **(4)** The thickness of horizontal wooden boards may also be determined having regard to the vertical distribution of the loading represented by Tables III and IV above and in such cases
```
t = 10 a sqrt [(p × k) / (h × 213.3)]
```
where:
- **t =** thickness of board in millimetres
- **a =** horizontal span of the board i.e. distance between uprights in metres
- **h =** head of grain to the bottom of the division in metres
- **p =** total load per unit length derived from Table I or II in kilograms
- **k =** factor dependent upon vertical distribution of the loading

- **(5)** When the vertical distribution of the loading is assumed to be uniform, i.e. rectangular, k shall be taken as equal to 1.0. For a trapezoidal distribution
```
k = 1.0 + 0.06 (50-R)
```
 where:
- **R ** is the upper end bearing reaction taken from Table III or IV.




**14** The sizes of stays and shores shall be so determined that the loads derived from Tables I and II to section 12 of this Schedule shall not exceed one-third of the breaking loads.







## Saucers

**15** 

- **(1)** When a saucer is used to reduce the heeling moments in a filled compartment, its depth, measured from the bottom of the saucer to the deck line, shall be as follows:
	- **(a)** for ships with a moulded breadth of up to 9.1 m not less than 1.2 m;
	- **(b)** for ships with a moulded breadth of 18.3 m or more, not less than 1.8 m; and
	- **(c)** for ships with a moulded breadth between 9.1 m and 18.3 m, the minimum depth of the saucer shall be calculated by interpolation.

- **(2)** The top (mouth) of the saucer shall be formed by the underdeck structure in the way of the hatchway, i.e. hatchside girders or coamings and hatchend beams.

- **(3)** Subject to section 16, the saucer and hatchway above shall be completely filled with bagged grain or other suitable cargo laid down on a separation cloth or its equivalent and stowed tightly against adjacent structures and the portable hatchway beams if the latter are in place.







## Bundling of Bulk

**16** 

- **(1)** As an alternative to filling the saucer with bagged grain or other suitable cargo a bundle of bulk grain may be used if
	- **(a)** the saucer is lined with a material that is acceptable to the Administration, is provided with suitable means for securing at the top, and has a tensile strength of not less than
		- **(i)** 2.68 kN/50 mm strip, or
		- **(ii)** 1.34 kN/50 mm strip if the saucer is constructed as follows:
			- **(A)** athwartship lashings acceptable to the Administration are placed inside the saucer formed in the bulk grain at intervals of not more than 2.4 m and are of sufficient length to permit being drawn up tight and secured at the top of the saucer, and
			- **(B)** dunnage not less than 25 mm in thickness or other suitable material of equal strength and between 150 to 300 mm in width is placed fore and aft over the lashings to prevent the cutting or chafing of the material that is placed thereon to line the saucer;
	- **(b)** the saucer is filled with bulk grain and secured at the top except that when using material approved under subparagraph (a)(ii) further dunnage shall be laid on top after lapping the material before the saucer is secured by setting up the lashings;
	- **(c)** where more than one sheet of material is used to line the saucer, those sheets are joined at the bottom either by sewing or a double lap; and
	- **(d)** the top of the saucer is coincidental with the bottom of the beams when these are in place.

- **(2)** Suitable general cargo or bulk grain may be placed between the beams on top of the saucer that is secured in accordance with subsection (1).







## Securing Hatch Covers of Filled Compartments

**17** If there is no bulk grain or other cargo above a filled compartment, the hatch covers shall be secured in a manner approved by the Administration having regard to the weight and permanent arrangements provided for securing such covers.









**PART II** 
## Securing of Partly Filled Compartment




## Strapping or Lashing

**18** Where, in order to eliminate heeling moments in partly filled compartments, strapping or lashing is utilized, the securing shall be accomplished as follows:
- **(a)** the grain shall be trimmed and levelled to the extent that it is very slightly crowned and covered with burlap separation cloths, tarpaulins or the equivalent;
- **(b)** the separation cloths and tarpaulins shall overlap at least 1.8 m;
- **(c)** one of the following arrangements shall be made:
	- **(i)** flooring consisting of
		- **(A)** two solid floors of rough 25 mm by 150 to 300 mm lumber with the top floor running longitudinally and nailed to an athwartships bottom floor, or
		- **(B)** one solid floor of 50 mm lumber running longitudinally and nailed over the top of a 50 mm bottom bearer not less than 150 mm wide,in which the bottom bearers extend the full breadth of the compartment and are spaced not more than 2.4 m apart, or
	- **(ii)** arrangements using other materials regarded by the Administration as equivalent to those described in subparagraph (i);
- **(d)** lashings consisting of
	- **(i)** steel wire rope with a diameter of 19 mm, at least four clips forming eyes, and set tight by a 32 mm turnbuckle,
	- **(ii)** doubled steel strapping of 50 mm by 1.3 mm having a breaking load of at least 49.03 kN, with at least three crimp seals for securing the ends and set tight by
		- **(A)** a 32 mm turnbuckle, or
		- **(B)** a winch tightener, used in conjunction with a locking arm, if suitable wrenches are available for setting up as necessary, or
	- **(iii)** chain of strength equivalent to the wire rope or strapping described in subparagraph (i) or (ii), set tight by a 32 mm turnbuckle;
- **(e)** prior to the completion of loading, the lashing shall be positively attached to the framing at a point approximately 450 mm below the anticipated final grain surface by means of either a 25 mm shackle or beam clamp of equivalent strength;
- **(f)** the lashings shall be spaced not more than 2.4 m apart and each shall be supported by a bearer that is nailed over the top of the fore and aft floor, consists of not less than 25 mm by 150 mm lumber or its equivalent and extends the full breadth of the compartment; and
- **(g)** during the voyage the strapping shall be regularly inspected and set up where necessary.







## Overstowing Arrangements

**19** 

- **(1)** Where bagged grain or other suitable cargo is utilized for the purpose of securing a partly filled compartment, the free grain surface shall be covered with a separation cloth or equivalent or by a suitable platform.

- **(2)** Such platforms shall consist of
	- **(a)** bearers spaced not more than 1.2 m apart and 25 mm boards laid thereon spaced not more than 100 mm apart; or
	- **(b)** other materials deemed by an Administration to be equivalent to those described in paragraph (a).







## Bagged Grain

**20** Bagged grain shall be carried in sound bags that are well filled and securely closed.
