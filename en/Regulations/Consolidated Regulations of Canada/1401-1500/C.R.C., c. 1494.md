**27** 

- **(1)** No pulley block shall be used in the processes unless the safe working load is clearly stamped upon it.

- **(2)** The safe working load of a single-sheave block is to be taken as the maximum load that can safely be lifted by the block when the load is attached to a rope passing around the sheave of the block.

- **(3)** In the case of a single-sheave block where the load is attached directly to the block instead of to a rope passing around the sheave, it is permissible to lift a load equal to twice the safe working load of the block as determined in subsection (2).

- **(4)** Where a rigging arrangement plan is available on board, it is permissible to use single-sheave blocks in any position where the maximum “working load” or “resultant” is not more than double the safe working load or half the proof load of the block.

- **(5)** Where no rigging arrangement plan is available on board, single-sheave blocks shall have a safe working load not less than the load being lifted or ***hook load***.

**28** Means shall be provided to enable any person using a chain or wire rope sling to ascertain the safe working load for such chain or sling under such conditions as it may be used, as follows:
- **(a)** for chain slings, such means shall consist of marking the safe working load in plain figures or letters on the sling or on a tablet or ring of durable material attached securely thereto; and
- **(b)** for wire rope slings, such means shall consist either of the means specified in paragraph (a) or a notice or notices, so exhibited as to be easily read by any person concerned, stating the safe working loads for the various sizes of wire rope slings used.




### Motors


**29** All motors, cog wheels, chains and friction gearing, shafting, line, electric conductors and steam pipes shall, unless it can be shown that by their position and construction they are equally as safe as if securely fenced, be securely fenced so far as is practicable without impeding the safe working of the ship.




### Safety Measures


**30** All cranes and winches shall be provided with such means as will reduce to a minimum the risk of the accidental descent of a load while being raised or lowered; in particular, the lever controlling the link motion reversing gear of a crane or winch shall be provided with a suitable spring or other locking arrangement.



**31** Appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent exhaust steam from, and, so far as is practicable, live steam to any crane or winch from obscuring any part of the decks, gangways, stages or wharves where any person is employed in the processes.



**32** Appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent the foot of a derrick from being accidentally lifted out of its socket or support.




### Compliance


**33** 

- **(1)** Any ship, registered elsewhere than in Canada, shall be deemed to have complied with the provisions of this Part in respect of testing, examination or heat treatment, as the case may be, if such testing, examination or heat treatment has been carried out in accordance with

### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(ss. 20, 21, 22 and 23)**
## Tests and Proof Loads
**1** 

- **(1)** Every winch with the whole of the gear accessory thereto (including derricks, goose-necks, eye plates, eye bolts or other attachments) shall be tested with a proof load that shall exceed the safe working load as follows:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Safe Working Load</th>
<th>Proof Load</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Up to 20 t </td>
<td>25 per cent in excess</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20-50 t </td>
<td>  5 t in excess</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Over 50 t </td>
<td>10 per cent in excess</td>
</tr>
</table>


- **(2)** The proof load shall be lifted with the ship’s normal tackle with the derrick at an angle that should not be more than 15 degrees from the horizontal or the lowest practicable angle at which the boom can be worked; the angle at which the test was made shall be stated in the certificate of test; after the proof load has been lifted it should be swung as far as possible in both directions.

- **(3)** All tests shall be carried out as required by subsection (2) by dead load, and no exception shall be allowed in the case of gear on new ships but, in the case of replacements or renewals, spring or hydraulic balances may be used where dead loads are not available and the gear being tested is not rigged for union purchase.

- **(4)** Where a spring or hydraulic balance is used, it shall be one that has been calibrated to the satisfaction of an inspector not more than 12 months prior to the test, and the test shall not be regarded as satisfactory unless the indicator remains constant for a period of at least five minutes.


**2** 

- **(1)** Every crane and other hoisting machine, with its accessory gear, shall be tested with a proof load that shall exceed the safe working load as follows:
<table>

<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Up to 20 t </td>

<td>  5 t in excess</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Over 50 t </td>
<td>10 per cent in excess</td>
</tr>
</table>


- **(2)** The proof load shall be lifted and swung as far as possible in both directions; if the jib of the crane has a variable radius, it should be tested with a proof load, as defined above, at the maximum and minimum radii of the jib; in hydraulic cranes where, owing to the limitations of pressure, it is impossible to lift a load of 25 per cent in excess of the safe working load, it will be sufficient to lift the greatest possible load.


**3** Wire ropes shall be tested by sample, a piece being tested to destruction, and the safe working load shall not exceed one-fifth of the breaking load of the sample tested.


**4** Chains, rings, hooks, shackles and other loose gear (whether accessory to a machine or not) shall be tested with a proof load equal to that shown against the article in the following table:
