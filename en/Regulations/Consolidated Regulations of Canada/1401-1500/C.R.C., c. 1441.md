### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(ss. 2, 3, 26, 40, 46 and 51)**
## Regulations for Determining Freeboards

**PART I** 


### General

**1** 

- **(1)** On every ship the cargo and ballast shall be stowed in such a manner as to ensure that the ship is sufficiently stable and is not subjected to excessive structural stress.

- **(2)** The Administration shall satisfy itself that the general structural strength of the hull of every ship is sufficient for the draught corresponding to the freeboard assigned. Ships built and maintained in conformity with the requirements of a classification society recognized by the Administration may be considered to possess adequate strength.





## Application

**2** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (5) and (6), ships with mechanical means of propulsion or lighters, barges or other ships without independent means of propulsion, shall be assigned freeboards in accordance with the provisions of Regulations 1-40 inclusive.

- **(2)** Ships carrying timber deck cargoes may be assigned, in addition to the freeboards prescribed in paragraph (1) of this Regulation, timber freeboards in accordance with the provisions of Regulations 41-45 inclusive.

- **(3)** Ships designed to carry sail, whether as the sole means of propulsion or as a supplementary means, and tugs, shall be assigned freeboards in accordance with the provisions of Regulations 1-40 inclusive. Such additional freeboard shall be required as determined by the Administration.

- **(4)** Ships of wood or composite construction, or of other materials the use of which the Administration has approved, or ships whose constructional features are such as to render the application of this Schedule unreasonable or impracticable, shall be assigned freeboards as determined by the Administration.

- **(5)** Regulations 10-26 inclusive shall apply to every ship to which a minimum freeboard is assigned. Relaxations from these requirements may be granted to a ship to which a greater than minimum freeboard is assigned on condition that the Administration is satisfied with the safety conditions provided.

- **(6)** The Board may assign to any dredger, sandsucker, open hopper barge or other ship of special design a freeboard that is less than the freeboard calculated in accordance with Part III of this Schedule, or partly or wholly exempt such a ship from the provisions of Regulation 14, if the ship
	- **(a)** is engaged in voyages that are not international voyages;
	- **(b)** meets the requirements for the issue of a Local Load Line Certificate; and
	- **(c)** is of such design and stability that such lesser freeboard or such exemption, as the case may be, will not adversely affect its safety.







## Definitions of Terms Used in the Schedules

**3** 

- **(1)** ***Length.*** The length (L) shall be taken as 96 per cent of the total length on a water line at 85 per cent of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or as the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that water line, if that is greater. In ships designed with a rake of keel the water line on which this length is measured shall be parallel to the designed water line.

- **(2)** ***Perpendiculars.*** The forward and after perpendiculars shall be taken at the forward and after ends of the length (L). The forward perpendicular shall coincide with the foreside of the stem on the water line on which the length is measured.

- **(3)** ***Amidships.*** Amidships is at the middle of the length (L).

- **(4)** ***Breadth.*** Unless expressly provided otherwise, the breadth (B) is the maximum breadth of the ship, measured amidships to the moulded line of the frame in a ship with a metal shell and to the outer surface of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other material.

- **(5)** ***Moulded Depth.***
	- **(a)** The moulded depth is the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.
	- **(b)** In ships having rounded gunwales, the moulded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the moulded lines of the deck and sides, the lines extending as though the gunwale were of angular design.
	- **(c)** Where the freeboard deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is to be determined, the moulded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck along a line parallel with the raised part.

- **(6)** ***Depth for Freeboard (D)***.
	- **(a)** The depth for freeboard (D) is the moulded depth amidships, plus the thickness of the freeboard deck stringer plate, where fitted, plus [T(L-S)]/L if the exposed freeboard deck is sheathed, where
		- **T** is the mean thickness of the exposed sheathing clear of deck openings, and
		- **S** is the total length of superstructures as defined in paragraph (9)(d).
	- **(b)** The depth for freeboard (D) in a ship having a rounded gunwale with a radius greater than four per cent of the breadth (B) or having topsides of unusual form is the depth for freeboard of a ship having a midship section with vertical topsides and with the same round of beam and area of topside section equal to that provided by the actual midship section.

- **(7)** ***Block Coefficient***. The block coefficient (C<sub>b</sub>) is given by:
```
<sup><a href='#footnote1star_e'>[ *]</a></sup>C<sub>b</sub>= ?/L.B.d<sub>1</sub>;
```
where
- **? ** is the volume of the moulded displacement of the ship, excluding bossing, in a ship with a metal shell, and is the volume of displacement to the outer surface of the hull in a ship with a shell of any other material, both taken at a moulded draught of d<sub>1</sub>; and where
- **d** <sub>1</sub>is 85 per cent of the least moulded depth.

<a name='footnote1star_e'><sup>*</sup></a>: For the purposes of this equation, the "?" represents the “vector differential” symbol.<br />

- **(8)** ***Freeboard Deck***. The freeboard deck is normally the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of closing all openings in the weather part thereof, and below which all openings in the sides of the ship are fitted with permanent means of watertight closing. In a ship having a discontinuous freeboard deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck. At the option of the owner and subject tot he approval of the Administration, a lower deck may be designated as the freeboard deck provided it is a complete and permanent deck continuous in a fore and aft direction at least between the machinery space and peak bulkheads and continuous athwart-ships. When this lower deck is stepped the lowest line of the deck and the continuation of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the freeboard deck. When a lower deck is designated as the freeboard deck, that part of the hull which extends above the freeboard deck is treated as a superstructure so far as concerns the application of the conditions of assignment and the calculation of freeboard. It is from this deck that the freeboard is calculated.

- **(9)** ***Superstructure***.
	- **(a)** A superstructure is a decked structure on the freeboard deck, extending from side to side of the ship or with the side plating not being inboard of the shell plating more than four per cent of the breadth (B). A raised quarter deck is regarded as a superstructure.
	- **(b)** An enclosed superstructure is a superstructure with:
		- **(i)** enclosing bulkheads of efficient construction,
		- **(ii)** access openings, if any, in these bulkheads fitted with doors complying with the requirements of Regulation 12,
		- **(iii)** all other openings in sides or ends of the superstructure fitted with efficient weathertight means of closing.A bridge or poop shall not be regarded as enclosed unless access is provided for the crew to reach machinery and other working spaces inside these superstructures by alternative means which are available at all times when bulkhead openings are closed.
	- **(c)** The height of a superstructure is the least vertical height measured at side from the top of the superstructure deck beams to the top of the freeboard deck beams.
	- **(d)** The length of a superstructure (S) is the mean length of the part of the superstructure which lies within the length (L).

- **(10)** ***Flush Deck Ship***. A flush deck ship os one which has no superstructure on the freeboard deck.

- **(11)** ***Weathertight***. Weathertight means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the ship.







## Deck Line

**4** The deck line is a horizontal line 300 mm in length and 23 mm in breadth. It shall be marked amidships on each side of the ship, and its upper edge shall normally pass through the point where the continuation outwards of the upper surface of the freeboard deck intersects the outer surface of the shell (as illustrated in Figure 1), provided that the deck line may be placed with reference to another fixed point on the ship on condition that the freeboard is correspondingly corrected. The location of the reference point and the identification of the freeboard deck shall in all cases be indicated on the International Load Line Certificate (1966).







## Load Line Mark

**5** The Load Line Mark shall consist of a ring 300 mm in outside diameter and 25 mm wide which is intersected by a horizontal line 450 mm in length and 25 mm in breadth, the upper edge of which passes through the centre of the ring. The centre of the ring shall be placed amidships and at a distance equal to the assigned summer freeboard measured vertically below the upper edge of the deck line (as illustrated in Figure 2).







## Lines to be used with the Load Line Mark

**6** 

- **(1)** The lines which indicate the load line assigned in accordance with these Regulations shall be horizontal lines 230 mm in length and 25 mm in breadth which extend forward of, unless expressly provided otherwise, and at right angles to, a vertical line 25 mm in breadth marked at a distance 540 mm forward of the centre of the ring (as illustrated in Figure 2).

- **(2)** The following load lines shall be used:

	- **(d)** the Tropical Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked T;
	- **(e)** the Fresh Water Load Line in summer indicated by the upper edge of a line marked F. The Fresh Water Load Line in summer is marked abaft the vertical line. The difference between the Fresh Water Load Line in summer and the Summer Load Line is the allowance to be made for loading in fresh water at the other load lines; and
	- **(f)** the Tropical Fresh Water Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked TF, and marked abaft the vertical line.

- **(3)** If timber freeboards are assigned in accordance with these Regulations, the timber load lines shall be marked in addition to ordinary load lines. These lines shall be horizontal lines 230 mm in length and 25 mm in breadth which extend abaft unless expressly provided otherwise, and are at right angles to, a vertical line 25 mm in breadth marked at a distance 540 mm abaft the centre of the ring (as illustrated in Figure 3).

- **(4)** The following timber load lines shall be used:
	- **(a)** the Summer Timber Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked LS;
	- **(b)** the Winter Timber Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked LW;
	- **(c)** the Winter North Atlantic Timber Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked LWNA;
	- **(d)** the Tropical Timber Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked LT;
	- **(e)** the Fresh Water Timber Load Line in summer indicated by the upper edge of a line marked LF and marked forward of the vertical line. The difference between the Fresh Water Timber Load Line in summer and the Summer Timber Load Line is the allowance to be made for loading in fresh water at the other timber load lines; and
	- **(f)** the Tropical Fresh Water Timber Load Line indicated by the upper edge of a line marked LTF and marked forward of the vertical line.

##  Freeing Ports

**24** 

- **(1)** Where bulwarks on the weather portions of freeboard or superstructure decks form wells, ample provision shall be made for rapidly freeing the decks of water and for draining them. Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this Regulation, the minimum freeing port area (A) on each side of the ship for each well on the freeboard deck shall be that given by the following formulas in cases where the sheer in way of the well is standard or greater than standard. The minimum area for each well on superstructure decks shall be one-half of the area given by the formulas.
Where the length of bulwark (l) in the well is 20 m or less
```
A = 0.7 + 0.035 l square metres
```
where 
- **l** exceeds 20 m
- **A** = 0.07 l square metres
l need in no case be taken as greater than 0.7 L.
If the bulwark is more than 1.2 m in average height, the required area shall be increased by 0.004 m<sup>2</sup> per metre of length of well for each 0.1 m difference in height. If the bulwark is less than 0.9 m in average height, the required area may be decreased by 0.004 m<sup>2</sup> per metre of length of well for each 0.1 m difference in height.

- **(2)** In ships with no sheer the area calculated according to subsection (1) of this Regulation shall be increased by 50 per cent. Where the sheer is less than the standard the percentage shall be obtained by linear interpolation.

- **(3)** Where a ship fitted with a trunk does not comply with the requirements of Regulation 36(1)(e) or where continuous or substantially continuous hatchway side coamings are fitted between detached superstructures, the minimum area of the freeing port openings shall be calculated from the following table:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Breadth of hatchway of trunk in relation to the breadth of ship</th>
<th>Area of freeing ports in relation to the total area of the bulwarks</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40% or less</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>75% or more</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</table>

The area of freeing ports at intermediate breadths shall be obtained by linear interpolation.

- **(4)** In ships having superstructures which are open at either or both ends, adequate provision for freeing the space within such superstructures shall be provided to the satisfaction of the Administration.

- **(5)** The lower edges of the freeing ports shall be as near the deck as practicable. Two-thirds of the freeing port area required shall be provided in the half of the well nearest the lowest point of the sheer curve.

**PART III** 
## Freeboards




## Types of Ships

**27** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of freeboard computation, ships shall be divided into Type ‘A' and Type ‘B'.

#### Type ‘A' ships


- **(2)** A Type ‘A' ship is one which is designed to carry only liquid cargoes in bulk, and in which cargo tanks have only small access openings closed by watertight gasketed covers of steel or equivalent material. Such a ship necessarily has the following inherent features:
	- **(a)** high integrity of the exposed deck; and
	- **(b)** high degree of safety against flooding, resulting from the low permeability of loaded cargo spaces and the degree of subdivision usually provided.

- **(3)** A Type ‘A' ship, if over 150 m in length, and designed to have empty compartments when loaded to its summer load water line, shall be able to withstand the flooding of any one of these empty compartments at an assumed permeability of 0.95, and remain afloat in a condition of equilibrium considered to be satisfactory by the Administration. In such a ship, if over 225 m in length, the machinery space shall be treated as a floodable compartment but with a permeability of 0.85.
For the guidance of Administrations the following limits may be regarded as satisfactory:
	- **(a)** the final water line after flooding is below the lower edge of any opening through which progressive flooding may take place;
	- **(b)** the maximum angle of heel due to unsymmetrical flooding is of the order of 15 degrees; and
	- **(c)** the metacentric height in the flooded condition is positive.

- **(4)** A Type ‘A' ship shall be assigned a freeboard not less than that based on Table I of Regulation 28.

#### Type ‘B' ships


- **(5)** All ships which do not come within the provisions regarding Type ‘A' ships in subsections (2) and (3) of this Regulation shall be considered as Type ‘B' ships.

- **(6)** Type ‘B' ships, which in position 1 have hatchways fitted with hatch covers complying with the requirements of Regulation 15(7) or 16 shall, except as provided in subsections (7) to (10) inclusive of this Regulation, be assigned freeboards based on Table II of Regulation 28.

- **(7)** Any Type ‘B' ships of over 100 m in length may be assigned freeboards less than those required under subsection (6) of this Regulation provided that, in relation to the amount of reduction granted, the Administration is satisfied that:
	- **(a)** the measures provided for the protection of the crew are adequate;
	- **(b)** the freeing arrangements are adequate;
	- **(c)** the covers in positions 1 and 2 comply with the provisions of Regulation 16 and have adequate strength, special care being given to their sealing and securing arrangements;
	- **(d)** this ship, when loaded to its summer load water line, will remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium after flooding of any single damaged compartment at an assumed permeability of 0.95 excluding the machinery space; and
	- **(e)** in such a ship, if over 225 m in length, the machinery space shall be treated as a floodable compartment but with a permeability of 0.85.
For the guidance of Administrations in applying paragraphs (7)(d) and (e), the limits given in paragraphs (3)(a), (b) and (c) may be regarded as satisfactory.
The relevant calculations may be based upon the following main assumptions:
— the vertical extent of damage is equal to the depth of the ship;
— the penetration of damage is not more than B/5;
— no main transverse bulkhead is damaged;
— the height of the centre of gravity above the base line is assessed allowing for homogeneous loading of cargo holds, and for 50 per cent of the designed capacity of consumable fluids and stores, etc.

- **(8)** In calculating the freeboards for Type ‘B' ships which comply with the requirements of subsection (7) of this Regulation, the values from Table II of Regulation 28 shall not be reduced by more than 60 per cent of the difference between the ‘B' and ‘A' tabular values for the appropriate ship lengths.

- **(9)** The reduction in tabular freeboard allowed under subsection (8) of this Regulation may be increased up to the total difference between the values in Table I and those in Table II of Regulation 28 on condition that the ship complies with the requirements of Regulations 26(1), (2), (3), (5) and (6), as if it were a Type ‘A' ship, and further complies with the provisions of paragraphs (7)(a) to (d) inclusive of this Regulation except that the reference in paragraph (d) to the flooding of any single damaged compartment shall be treated as a reference to the flooding of any two adjacent fore and aft compartments, neither of which is the machinery space. Also any such ship of over 225 m in length, when loaded to its summer load water line, shall remain afloat in a satisfactory condition of equilibrium after flooding of the machinery space, taken alone, at an assumed permeability of 0.85.

- **(10)** Type ‘B' ships, which in position 1 have hatchways fitted with hatch covers which comply with the requirements of Regulation 15, other than subsection (7), shall be assigned freeboards based upon the values given in Table II of Regulation 28 increased by the values given in the following table:

Freeboards at intermediate lengths of ship shall be obtained by linear interpolation.
Ships above 200 m in length shall be dealt with by the Administration.

- **(11)** A lighter, barge or other ship without independent means of propulsion shall be assigned a freeboard in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations. However, in the case of barges which are unmanned, the requirements of Regulations 25, 26(2) and (3) and 39 shall not apply. Such unmanned barges, which have on the freeboard deck only small access openings closed by weathertight gasketed covers of steel or equivalent material, may be assigned freeboards 25 per cent less than those calculated in accordance with these Regulations.

## Correction to the Freeboard for Ships under 100 m in length

**29** The tabular freeboard for a Type ‘B' ship of between 24 m and 100 m in length having enclosed superstructures with an effective length of up to 35 per cent of the length of the ship shall be increased by:
```
7.5 (100 - L)(0.35 - E/L) millimetres
```
where
- **L** = length of ship in metres,where
- **E** = effective length of superstructure in metres as defined in Regulation 35.







## Correction for Block Coefficient

**30** Where the block coefficient (C<sub>b</sub>) exceeds 0.68, the tabular freeboard specified in Regulation 28 as modified, if applicable, by Regulations 27(8), 27(10) and 29 shall be multiplied by the factor (C<sub>b</sub> + 0.68) / 1.36.







## Correction for Depth

**31** 

- **(1)** Where D exceeds L/15 the freeboard shall be increased by (D - L/15) R millimetres, where R is L/0.48 at length less than 120 m and 250 at 120 m length and above.

- **(2)** Where D is less than L/15, no reduction shall be made except in a ship with an enclosed superstructure covering at least 0.6 L amidships, with a complete trunk, or combination of detached enclosed superstructures and trunks which extend all fore and aft, where the freeboard shall be reduced at the rate prescribed in paragraph (1) of this Regulation.

- **(3)** Where the height of superstructure or trunk is less than the standard height, the reduction shall be in the ratio of the actual to the standard height as defined in Regulation 33.







## Correction for Position of Deck Line

**32** Where the actual depth to the upper edge of the deck line is greater or less than D, the difference between the depths shall be added to or deducted from the freeboard.

The standard heights at intermediate lengths of the ship shall be obtained by linear interpolation.







## Length of Superstructure

**34** 

- **(1)** Except as provided in subsection (2) of this Regulation, the length of a superstructure (S) shall be the mean length of the parts of the superstructure which lie within the length (L).

- **(2)** Where the end bulkhead of an enclosed superstructure extends in a fair convex curve beyond its intersection with the superstructure sides, the length of the superstructure may be increased on the basis of an equivalent plane bulkhead. This increase shall be two-thirds of the fore and aft extent of the curvature. The maximum curvature which may be taken into account in determining this increase is one-half the breadth of the superstructure at the point of intersection of the curved end of the superstructure with its side.







## Effective Length of Superstructure

**35** 

- **(1)** Except as provided for in subsection (2) of this Regulation, the effective length (E) of an enclosed superstructure of standard height shall be its length.

- **(2)** In all cases where an enclosed superstructure of standard height is set in from the sides of the ship as permitted in subsection 3(9) of this Schedule the effective length is the length modified by the ratio of b/Bs, where
“b” is the breadth of the superstructure at the middle of its length, and
“Bs” is the breadth of the ship at the middle of the length of the superstructure, and
where a superstructure is set in for a part of its length, this modification shall be applied only to the set in part.

- **(3)** Where the height of an enclosed superstructure is less than the standard height, the effective length shall be its length reduced in the ratio of the actual height to the standard height. Where the height exceeds the standard, no increase shall be made to the effective length of the superstructure.

- **(4)** The effective length of a raised quarter deck, if fitted with an intact front bulkhead, shall be its length up to a maximum of 0.6 L. Where the bulkhead is not intact, the raised quarter deck shall be treated as a poop of less than standard height.

- **(5)** Superstructures which are not enclosed shall have no effective length.







## Trunks

**36** 

- **(1)** A trunk or similar structure which does not extend to the sides of the ship shall be regarded as efficient on the following conditions:
	- **(a)** the trunk is at least as strong as a superstructure;
	- **(b)** the hatchways are in the trunk deck, and the hatchway coamings and covers comply with the requirements of Regulations 13 to 16 inclusive and the width of the trunk deck stringer provides a satisfactory gangway and sufficient lateral stiffness. However, small access openings with watertight covers may be permitted in the freeboard deck;
	- **(c)** a permanent working platform fore and aft fitted with guard-rails is provided by the trunk deck, or by detached trunks connected to superstructures by efficient permanent gangways;
	- **(d)** ventilators are protected by the trunk, by watertight covers or by other equivalent means;
	- **(e)** open rails are fitted on the weather parts of the freeboard deck in way of the trunk for at least half their length;
	- **(f)** the machinery casings are protected by the trunk, by a superstructure of at least standard height, or by a deckhouse of the same height and of equivalent strength;
	- **(g)** the breadth of the trunk is at least 60 per cent of the breadth of the ship; and
	- **(h)** where there is no superstructure, the length of the trunk is at least 0.6 L.

- **(2)** The full length of an efficient trunk reduced in the ratio of its mean breadth to B shall be its effective length.

- **(3)** The standard height of a trunk is the standard height of a superstructure other than a raised quarter deck.

- **(4)** Where the height of a trunk is less than the standard height, its effective length shall be reduced in the ratio of the actual to the standard height. Where the height of the hatchway coamings on the trunk deck is less than that required under Regulation 15(1), a reduction from the actual height of trunk shall be made which corresponds to the difference between the actual and the required height of coaming.







## Deduction for Superstructures and Trunks

**37** 

- **(1)** Where the effective length of superstructures and trunks is 1.0 L, the deduction from the freeboard shall be 350 mm at 24 m length of ship, 860 mm at 85 m length, and 1 070 mm at 122 m length and above; deductions at intermediate lengths shall be obtained by linear interpolation.

- **(2)** Where the total effective length of superstructures and trunks is less than 1.0 L the deduction shall be a percentage obtained from one of the following tables:

## Sheer




## *General*

**38** 

- **(1)** The sheer shall be measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line amidships.

- **(2)** In ships designed with a rake of keel, the sheer shall be measured in relation to a reference line drawn parallel to the design load water line.

- **(3)** In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures the sheer shall be measured at the freeboard deck.

- **(4)** In ships with topsides of unusual form in which there is a step or break in the topsides, the sheer shall be considered in relation to the equivalent depth amidships.

- **(5)** In ships with a superstructure of standard height which extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer shall be measured at the superstructure deck. Where the height exceeds the standard the least difference (Z) between the actual and standard heights shall be added to each end ordinate. Similarly, the intermediate ordinates at distances of 1/6 L and 1/3 L from each perpendicular shall be increased by 0.444 Z and 0.111 Z respectively.

- **(6)** Where the deck of an enclosed superstructure has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck shall not be taken into account.

- **(7)** Where an enclosed poop or forecastle is of standard height with greater sheer than that of the freeboard deck, or is of more than standard height, an addition to the sheer of the freeboard deck shall be made as provided in subsection (12) of this Regulation.

#### Standard Sheer Profile

##### *Measurement of Variation from Standard Sheer Profile*


- **(9)** Where the sheer profile differs from the standard, the four ordinates of each profile in the forward or after half shall be multiplied by the appropriate factors given in the table of ordinates. The difference between the sums of the respective products and those of the standard divided by eight measures the deficiency or excess of sheer in the forward or after half. The arithmetical mean of the excess or deficiency in the forward and after halves measures the excess or deficiency of sheer.

- **(10)** Where the after half of the sheer profile is greater than the standard and the forward half is less than the standard, no credit shall be allowed for the part in excess and deficiency only shall be measured.

- **(11)** Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the standard, and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than 75 per cent of the standard, credit shall be allowed for the part in excess; where the after part is less than 50 per cent of the standard, no credit shall be given for the excess sheer forward. Where the after sheer is between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the standard, intermediate allowances may be granted for excess sheer forward.

- **(12)** Where sheer credit is given for a poop or forecastle the following formula shall be used:
```
s = y/3 L′/L
```
where
- **s** = sheer credit, to be deducted from the deficiency or added to the excess of sheer,
- **y** = difference between actual and standard height of superstructure at the end of sheer,
- **L′** = mean enclosed length of poop or forecastle up to a maximum length of 0.5 L,
- **L** = length of ship as defined in Regulation 3(1).
The above formula provides a curve in the form of a parabola tangent to the actual sheer curve at the freeboard deck and intersecting the end ordinate at a point below the superstructure deck a distance equal to the standard height of a superstructure. The superstructure deck shall not be less than standard height above this curve at any point. This curve shall be used in determining the sheer profile for forward and after halves of the ship.

#### Correction for Variations from Standard Sheer Profile


- **(13)** The correction for sheer shall be the deficiency or excess of sheer (see subsections (9) to (11) inclusive of this Regulation), multiplied by
```
0.75 - (S / 2 L)
```
where
- **S** is the total length of enclosed superstructures.

#### Addition for Deficiency in Sheer


- **(14)** Where the sheer is less than the standard, the correction for deficiency in sheer (see subsection (13) of this Regulation) shall be added to the freeboard.

#### Deduction for Excess Sheer


- **(15)** In ships where an enclosed superstructure covers 0.1 L before and 0.1 L abaft amidships, the correction for excess of sheer as calculated under the provisions of subsection (13) of this Regulation shall be deducted from the freeboard; in ships where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no deduction shall be made from the freeboard; where an enclosed superstructure covers less than 0.1 L before and 0.1 L abaft amidships, the deduction shall be obtained by linear interpolation. The maximum deduction for excess sheer shall be at the rate of 125 mm per 100 m of length.









## Minimum Bow Height

**39** 

- **(1)** The bow height defined as the vertical distance at the forward perpendicular between the water line corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard and the designed trim and the top of the exposed deck at side shall be not less than:
for ships below 250 m in length,
```
56 L (1 - L/500 [1.36 / (C<sub>b</sub> + 0.68)]) millimetres;
```

for ships of 250 m and above in length,
```
7 000 [1.36 / (C<sub>b</sub> + 0.68)]) millimetres;
```
where 
- **L** is the length of the ship in metres,
- **C** <sub>b</sub>is the block coefficient which is to be taken as not less than 0.68.

- **(2)** Where the bow height required subsection (1) of this Regulation is obtained by sheer, the sheer shall extend for at least 15 per cent of the length of the ship measured from a forward perpendicular. Where it is obtained by fitting a superstructure, such superstructure shall extend from the stem to a point at least 0.07 L abaft the forward perpendicular, and it shall comply with the following requirements:
	- **(a)** for ships not over 100 m in length it shall be enclosed as defined in Regulation 3(9); and
	- **(b)** for ships over 100 m in length it shall be fitted with satisfactory closing appliances.

- **(3)** Ships which, to suit exceptional operational requirements, cannot meet the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this Regulation may be given special consideration by the Administration.







## Minimum Freeboards






## Summer Freeboard

**40** 

- **(1)** The minimum freeboard in summer shall be the freeboard derived from the tables in Regulation 28 as modified by the corrections in Regulations 27, as applicable, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37, 38 and, if applicable, 39.

- **(2)** The freeboard in salt water, as calculated in accordance with subsection (1) of this Regulation, but without the correction for deck line, as provided by Regulation 32, shall not be less than 50 mm. For ships having in position 1 hatchways with covers which do not comply with the requirements of Regulation 15(7), 16 or 26, the freeboard shall be not less than 150 mm.

#### Tropical Freeboard


- **(3)** The minimum freeboard in the Tropical Zone shall be the freeboard obtained by a deduction from the summer freeboard of 1/48th of the summer draught measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the ring of the load line mark.

- **(4)** The freeboard in salt water, as calculated in accordance with subsection (3) of this Regulation, but without the correction for deck line, as provided by Regulation 32, shall not be less than 50 mm. For ships having in position 1 hatchways with covers which do not comply with the requirements of Regulation 15(7), 16 or 26, the freeboard shall be not less than 150 mm.

#### Winter Freeboard


- **(5)** The minimum freeboard in winter shall be the freeboard obtained by an addition to the summer freeboard of 1/48th of summer draught, measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the ring of the load line mark.

#### Winter North Atlantic Freeboard


- **(6)** The minimum freeboard for ships of not more than 100 m in length that enter any part of the North Atlantic defined in section 7 of Schedule II during the winter seasonal period shall be the winter freeboard plus 50 mm. For other ships, the Winter North Atlantic Freeboard shall be the winter freeboard.

#### Fresh Water Freeboard


- **(7)** The minimum freeboard in fresh water of unit density shall be obtained by deducting from the minimum freeboard in salt water:
```
Δ / 4 T millimetres
```
where
- **Δ** = displacement in salt water in tonnes at the summer load water line,
- **T** = tonnes per centimetre immersion in salt water at the summer load water line.

- **(8)** Where the displacement at the summer load water line cannot be certified, the deduction shall be 1/48th of summer draught, measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the ring of the load line mark.









**PART IV** 
## Special Requirements for Ships Assigned Timber Freeboards




## Application of This Part

**41** Regulations 42 to 45 inclusive apply only to ships to which timber load lines are assigned.







## Definitions

**42** 

- **(1)** ***Timber Deck Cargo***. The term ***timber deck cargo*** means a cargo of timber carried on an uncovered part of a freeboard or superstructure deck. The term does not include wood pulp or similar cargo.

- **(2)** ***Timber Load Line***. A timber deck cargo may be regarded as giving a ship a certain additional buoyancy and a greater degree of protection against the sea. For that reason, ships carrying a timber deck cargo may be granted a reduction of freeboard calculated according to the provisions of Regulation 45 and marked on the ship’s side in accordance with the provisions of Regulations 6(3) and (4). However, in order that such special freeboard may be granted and used, the timber deck cargo shall comply with certain conditions which are laid down in Regulation 44, and the ship itself shall also comply with certain conditions relating to its construction which are set out in Regulation 43.







## Construction of Ship






## Superstructure

**43** 

- **(1)** Ships shall have a forecastle of at least standard height and a length of at least 0.07 L. In addition, if the ship is less than 100 m in length, a poop of at least standard height, or a raised quarter deck with either a deckhouse or a strong steel hood of at least the same total height shall be fitted aft.

#### Double Bottom Tanks


- **(2)** Double bottom tanks where fitted within the midship half length of the ship shall have adequate watertight longitudinal subdivision.

#### Bulwarks


- **(3)** The ship shall be fitted either with permanent bulwarks at least 1 m in height, specially stiffened on the upper edge and supported by strong bulwark stays attached to the deck and provided with necessary freeing ports, or with efficient rails of the same height and of specially strong construction.







## Stowage






## General

**44** 

- **(1)** Openings in the weather deck over which cargo is stowed shall be securely closed and battened down. The ventilators shall be efficiently protected.

- **(2)** Timber deck cargo shall extend over at least the entire available length which is the total length of the well or wells between superstructures.
