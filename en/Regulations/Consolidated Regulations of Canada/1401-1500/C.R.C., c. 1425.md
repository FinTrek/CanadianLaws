## Limits of Submergence


**19** 

- **(1)** Subject to sections 22 and 23, the maximum depth in salt water to which a ship that is not a Canadian ship that is flying the flag of a country that is a party to the 1930 Convention only may be loaded is described in Part VII of Schedule I.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (5) and sections 22 and 23, the maximum depth in salt water to which a ship, other than a ship described in subsection (1), may be loaded is to the upper edge of the load line corresponding to the seasonal period described in Schedule IV in respect of a seasonal zone or a seasonal area described in that Schedule, while the ship is in that zone or area during that period.

- **(3)** Where a ship is assigned timber freeboards and is not
	- **(a)** in the North American Great Lakes Zone, or
	- **(b)** making a voyage wholly within the limits of the North American Great Lakes Zone and the St. Lawrence River Seasonal Area,
any reference in subsections (2) and (5) to a load line shall be deemed to be a reference to a timber load line.

	- **(b)** the period from November 1st in one year to March 31st in the next year, while the ship is in that part of the North Atlantic Winter Seasonal Zone II, as described in Schedule IV, that lies between the meridian of longitude 15°W and 50°W.



**20** 

- **(1)** Subject to section 21, a ship in fresh water of unit density may be loaded so as to submerge to the depth permitted in section 19 plus the amount of the fresh water allowance calculated in accordance with section 57 of Schedule I.

- **(2)** Subject to section 21, a ship in water of other than unit density may be loaded so as to submerge to the depth permitted in section 19 plus the allowance calculated in accordance with section 57 of Schedule I made proportional to the difference between 1.025 and the actual density.



**21** Section 20 does not apply to a ship that
- **(a)** is in the North American Great Lakes Zone at any time during the period from September 16th in any year to April 30th in the next year; or
- **(b)** would submerge all assigned load lines were it to submerge the appropriate load line by the amount of the fresh water allowance.



**22** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), when a ship departs from a place in inland waters, the ship may be loaded so as to submerge to a greater depth than that permitted by section 19 or 20, which greater depth shall correspond to the weight of fuel and all other materials required for consumption between the point of departure and the sea.

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply to a ship in
	- **(a)** the North American Great Lakes Zone; or
	- **(b)** the St. Lawrence River Seasonal Area where that ship is making a voyage wholly within the limits of that Area and the North American Great Lakes Zone.



**23** Where a load line referred to in Part VII of Schedule I or in Schedule II is not marked on the sides of the ship, the point on each side of the ship coinciding with the lower limit of the freeboard that is assigned or should have been assigned to that ship and that corresponds to that load line is the maximum depth in salt water to which a steamship may be loaded while in the zone or area that corresponds to that load line during the season corresponding to that load line.




### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(ss. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.1, 11, 19, 20 and 23)**
## Freeboards and Marking



## interpretation

**1** 

- **(1)** In this Schedule,

***amidships*** means the middle of the length of the summer load waterline as defined in subsection (2); (*milieu du navire*)

***Assigning Authority*** means the Chairman or a classification society authorized pursuant to section 421 of the Act; (*autorité habilitée*)

***flush deck ship*** means a ship with no superstructure on the freeboard deck; (*navire au pont ras*)

***freeboard deck*** means the uppermost complete deck having permanent means of closing all openings in weather portions of the deck in accordance with sections 3 to 10, and in flush deck ships and ships with detached superstructures means the upper deck; in ships having discontinuous freeboard decks within superstructures that are not intact, or that are not fitted with Class 1 closing appliances as defined in subsection (12), the lowest line of the deck below the superstructure deck shall be deemed to be the freeboard deck; (*pont de franc-bord*)

***superstructure*** means a decked structure on the freeboard deck extending from side to side of the ship, and includes a raised quarter deck and a bridge of set in construction complying with the provisions of subsection (32); (*superstructure*)

***superstructure deck*** means the deck forming the top of the superstructure; (*pont de superstructure*)

***surveyor*** means an inspector or a person authorized by an Assigning Authority to conduct surveys. (*expert maritime*)

- **(2)** The length (L) for the purposes of this Schedule is the length in metres on the summer load waterline from the foreside of the stem to the afterside of the rudder post; where there is no rudder post, the length is measured from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock; for ships with cruiser sterns, the length shall be taken as 96 per cent of the total length on the designed summer load waterline or as the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock if that be the greater.

- **(3)** The breadth (B) for the purposes of this Schedule is the maximum breadth in metres amidships to the moulded line of the frame in iron or steel ships, and to the outside of the planking in wood or composite ships.

- **(4)** The moulded depth is the vertical distance in metres measured amidships, from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side; in wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet; where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the depth is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

- **(5)** The depth (D) for the purposes of this Schedule is
	- **(a)** the moulded depth plus the thickness of stringer plate, or plus
```
T (L-S) / L
```
if that be greater, where
- **T** is the mean thickness of the exposed deck clear of deck openings, and
- **S** is the total length of superstructures as defined in subsection (9);
	- **(b)** where the topsides are of unusual form, the depth of a midship section having vertical topsides, standard round of beam and area of topside section equal to that in the actual midship section and, where there is a step or break in the topsides (e.g., as in the turret deck ship) 70 per cent of the area above the step or break is included in the area used to determine the equivalent; and
	- **(c)** in a ship without an enclosed superstructure covering at least 0.6L amidships, without a complete trunk or without a combination of intact partial superstructures and trunk extending all fore and aft, where D is less than
```
L / 15
```

the depth used with the table set out in section 58 of this Schedule shall not be taken as less than L / 15.

- **(6)** The coefficient of fineness (c) for the purposes of this Schedule is obtained by the formula:
```
c = 0.976 Δ / L.B.d<sub>1</sub>
```
where 
- **Δ** is the ship’s moulded displacement (excluding bossing) in salt water in tonnes at a mean moulded draught d<sub>1</sub>, which is 85 per cent of the moulded depth, and where the coefficient (c) is not taken as less than 0.68.

- **(7)** The height of a superstructure is the least vertical height measured from the top of the superstructure deck to the top of the freeboard deck beams minus the difference between the moulded depth and D as defined in subsections (4) and (5).

- **(8)** The standard height of a raised quarter deck is 0.91 m for ships up to and including 30.5 m in length, 1.22 m for ships 76.2 m in length and 1.83 m for ships 121.9 m in length and above; the standard height of any other superstructure or of a trunk is 1.83 m for ships up to and including 76.2 m in length and 2.29 m for ships 121.9 m in length and above; the standard height at intermediate lengths is obtained by interpolation.

- **(9)** The length of a superstructure (S) is the mean covered length of the parts of the superstructure that extend to the sides of the ship and lie within lines drawn perpendicular to the extremities of the summer load waterline, as defined in subsection (2).

- **(10)** A detached superstructure is regarded as enclosed only where
	- **(a)** the enclosing bulkheads are of efficient construction as required by subsection (11);
	- **(b)** the access openings in these bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 or Class 2 closing appliances (as defined in subsections (12) and (13));
	- **(c)** all other openings in sides or ends of the superstructure are fitted with efficient weathertight means of closing; and
	- **(d)** independent means of access to crew, machinery, bunker and other working spaces within bridges and poops are at all times available when the bulkhead openings are closed.

- **(11)** Bulkheads at exposed ends of poops, bridges and forecastles are deemed to be of efficient construction where the Assigning Authority is satisfied that, in the circumstances, they are equivalent to the following standard for ships with minimum freeboards: the stiffeners and plating are of the scantlings given in the table to this section, the stiffeners are spaced 760 mm apart, the stiffeners on poop and bridge front bulkheads have efficient end connections, and those on after bulkheads of bridges and forecastles extend for the whole distance between the margin angles of the bulkheads.

	- **(c)** if the sheer forward of amidships is between the standard and half the standard sheer, the percentage of the length of the forecastle forward of 0.1L from the forward perpendicular, that is the same percentage as the actual sheer forward of amidships is to the standard sheer.

- **(28)** Fifty per cent of the length of an open extension beyond the bulkhead or beyond 0.1L from the forward perpendicular shall be the effective length.

- **(29)** A trunk or similar structure that does not extend to the sides of the ship shall be regarded as efficient provided that
	- **(a)** the trunk is at least as strong as a superstructure;
	- **(b)** the hatchways are in the trunk deck and comply with the requirements of sections 3 to 10 of this Schedule, and the width of the trunk deck stringer provides a satisfactory gangway and sufficient lateral stiffness;
	- **(c)** a permanent working platform fore and aft fitted with guard rails is provided by the trunk deck or by detached trunks connected to other superstructures by efficient permanent gangways;
	- **(d)** ventilators are protected by the trunk, by watertight covers or by equivalent means;
	- **(e)** open rails are fitted on the weather portions of the freeboard deck in way of the trunk for at least half their length; and
	- **(f)** the machinery casings are protected by the trunk, by a superstructure of standard height, or by a deck house of the same height and of equivalent strength.

- **(30)** Where access openings in poop and bridge bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, 100 per cent of the length of an efficient trunk reduced in the ratio of its mean breadth to B (as defined in subsection (3)), shall be added to the effective length of the superstructures; where the access openings in these bulkheads are not fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, 90 per cent of the length reduced as above shall be added.

- **(31)** Where the height of the trunk is less than the standard height, the addition referred to in subsection (30) shall be reduced in the ratio of the actual to the standard height; where the height of hatchway coamings on the trunk deck is less than the height of coamings as required by section 4 of this Schedule, a reduction from the actual height of trunk shall be made corresponding to the difference between the actual height of the coamings and the height required by section 4 of this Schedule.

- **(32)** A bridge structure that is ‘set in’ shall be regarded as efficient provided that
	- **(a)** the transverse amount of ‘set in’ on each side of the ship at any point shall not exceed 305 mm inside the full breadth of the ship at that point;
	- **(b)** the longitudinal extent of the ‘set in’ shall not exceed the midship 4/10 of the length of the ship as defined in subsection (2);

	- **(b)** where efficient temporary closing appliances as defined in subsection (14) are provided for middle line deck openings and the breadth of opening is less than 0.8B<sub>1</sub>, the effective length of superstructure between openings shall be ascertained by applying subsections (19) to (21) and (23) to (28) except that where access openings in ‘tween deck bulkheads are closed by Class 2 closing appliances, they shall be regarded as being closed by Class 1 closing appliances; the total effective length shall be obtained by adding to the length thus determined the difference between that length and the length of the ship modified in the ratio of
(B<sub>1</sub> - b) / B<sub>1</sub> where b = breadth of deck opening;
where (B<sub>1</sub> - b) / B<sub>1</sub> is greater than 0.5 it is taken as 0.5.

Depths for hatchway beams are at the middle of the length and are measured from the top mounting to the lower edge. Depths for fore-and-afters are measured from the under side of the hatch-covers to the lower edge. Sizes for intermediate lengths and spacing are obtained by interpolation. Where plates are specified, two angles of the size given for mountings, are to be fitted at the upper and at the lower part of the beam. Where bulb plates are specified, two angles, of the size given for mountings, are to be fitted at the upper part of the beam or fore-and-after. Where bulb angles are specified, one angle, of the size given for mountings, is to be fitted at the upper part of the section. Where the specified flanges of an angle are of different dimensions, the larger flange is to be horizontal.

La hauteur des barrots mobiles est la hauteur au milieu de leur longueur. Elle est mesurée depuis l’armature supérieure jusqu’au bord inférieur. La hauteur des galiotes est mesurée depuis la face inférieure des panneaux de fermeture jusqu’au bord inférieur. Pour des longueurs et écartements intermédiaires, les dimensions sont obtenues par interpolation. Lorsque l’emploi de tôles est exigé, deux cornières ayant les dimensions spécifiées pour les armatures doivent être placées à la partie haute et à la partie basse du barrot mobile. Lorsque des tôles à boudin sont exigées, deux cornières ayant les dimensions exigées pour les armatures doivent être placées à la partie supérieure du barrot mobile ou de la galiote. Lorsque des cornières à boudin sont exigées, une cornière ayant les dimensions exigées pour les armatures doit être placée à la partie haute. Lorsque les largeurs exigées pour les branches d’une cornière sont différentes, la branche la plus large doit être disposée horizontalement.

*In ships not exceeding 30.5 m in length, the depths of beams which are formed of plates and angles may be 60 per cent of the depths given above; the depths of beams and steel fore-and-afters formed of bulb angle or bulb plate section may be 80 per cent of the depths given above; the thickness of plates, bulb angles and bulb plates should correspond to the thickness tabulated for the reduced depths with a minimum thickness of 7.5 mm, the depths and breadths of wood fore-and-afters may be 80 per cent of those given in the tables for side fore-and-afters, but the centre fore-and-afters must not be less than 165 mm wide. In ships between 30.5 m and 61 m in length, the sizes of the beams and fore-and-afters are to be determined by linear interpolation.

*Dans les navires dont la longueur ne dépasse pas 30,5 m, la hauteur des barrots mobiles constitués par des tôles et des cornières peut être égale à 60 pour cent de la hauteur donnée à la table; la hauteur des barrots mobiles et des galiotes en acier constitués par une cornière à boudin ou par une tôle à boudin peut être égale à 80 pour cent de la hauteur donnée à la table; l’épaisseur des tôles, cornières à boudin et tôles à boudin doit être celle qui correspond, dans la table, à la hauteur réduite, sans toutefois que cette épaisseur puisse être inférieure à 7,5 mm; les hauteurs et les largeurs des galiotes en bois peuvent être égales à 80 pour cent des dimensions données à la table pour les galiotes latérales, mais les galiotes centrales ne doivent pas avoir une largeur inférieure à 165 mm. Dans les navires dont la longueur est comprise entre 30,5 et 61 m les dimensions des barrots et des galiotes doivent être déterminées par interpolation linéaire.

Depths for hatchway beams are at the middle of the length and are measured from the top mounting to the lower edge. Depths for fore-and-afters are measured from the under side of the hatch-covers to the lower edge. Sizes for intermediate lengths and spacing are obtained by interpolation. Where plates are specified, two angles, of the size given for mountings, are to be fitted at the upper and at the lower part of the beam. Where bulb plates are specified, two angles, of the size given for mountings, are to be fitted at the upper part of the beam or fore-and-after. Where bulb angles are specified, one angle, of the size given for mountings, is to be fitted at the upper part of the section. Where the specified flanges of an angle are of different dimensions, the larger flange is to be horizontal.

La hauteur des barrots mobiles est la hauteur au milieu de leur longueur. Elle est mesurée depuis l’armature supérieure jusqu’au bord inférieur. La hauteur des galiotes est mesurée depuis la face inférieure des panneaux de fermeture jusqu’au bord inférieur. Pour des longueurs et écartements intermédiaires, les dimensions sont obtenues par interpolation. Lorsque l’emploi de tôles est exigé, deux cornières ayant les dimensions spécifiées pour les armatures doivent être placées à la partie haute et à la partie basse du barrot mobile. Lorsque des tôles à boudin sont exigées, deux cornières ayant les dimensions exigées pour les armatures doivent être placées à la partie supérieure du barrot mobile ou de la galiote. Lorsque des cornières à boudin sont exigées, une cornière ayant les dimensions exigées pour les armatures doit être placée à la partie haute. Lorsque les largeurs exigées pour les branches d’une cornière sont différentes, la branche la plus large doit être disposée horizontalement.

*In ships not exceeding 30.5 m in length, the depths of beams which are formed of plates and angles may be 60 per cent of the depths given above; the depths of beams and steel fore-and-afters formed of bulb angle or bulb plate section may be 80 per cent of the depths given above; the thickness of plates, bulb angles and bulb plates should correspond to the thickness tabulated for the reduced depths with a minimum thickness of 7.5 mm; the depths and breadths of wood fore-and-afters may be 80 per cent of those given in the tables for side fore-and-afters, but the centre fore-and-afters must not be less than 165 mm wide. In ships between 30.5 m and 61 m in length, the sizes of the beams and fore-and-afters are to be determined by linear interpolation.

*Dans les navires dont la longueur ne dépasse pas 30,5 m, la hauteur des barrots mobiles constitués par des tôles et des cornières peut être égale à 60 pour cent de la hauteur donnée à la table; la hauteur des barrots mobiles et des galiotes en acier constitués par une cornière à boudin ou par une tôle à boudin peut être égale à 80 pour cent de la hauteur donnée à la table; l’épaisseur des tôles, cornières à boudin et tôles à boudin doit être celle qui correspond, dans la table, à la hauteur réduite, sans toutefois que cette épaisseur puisse être inférieure à 7,5 mm; les hauteurs et les largeurs des galiotes en bois peuvent être égales à 80 pour cent des dimensions données à la table pour les galiotes latérales, mais les galiotes centrales ne doivent pas avoir une largeur inférieure à 165 mm. Dans les navires dont la longueur est comprise entre 30,5 et 61 m, les dimensions des barrots et des galiotes doivent être déterminées par interpolation linéaire.

**25** Notwithstanding anything in this Part, the Assigning Authority may, in any exceptional case, allow departures from the provisions thereof on condition that the freeboards computed for the ship are increased to such extent as will, in the opinion of the Board, secure that the protection afforded to the ship and crew is not less effective than it would be if the ship fully complied with the said provisions and there had been no increase of freeboards.


**26** 

- **(1)** The Assigning Authority shall be satisfied with the structural strength of any ship before assigning to it a freeboard.

- **(2)** Ships that comply with the highest standard of the rules of a classification society authorized pursuant to section 421 of the Act shall be regarded as having sufficient strength for the minimum freeboards allowed under these Rules.

- **(3)** Ships that do not comply with the highest standard of the rules of a classification society authorized as aforesaid shall be assigned such increased freeboards as shall be determined by the Assigning Authority, having regard to the extent to which the ship complies with the following strength moduli:
	- **(a)** Material — The strength moduli are based on the assumption that the structure is built of mild steel, manufactured by the open hearth process (acid or basic), and having a tensile strength of 401 to 494 MPa, and an elongation of at least 16 per cent on a length of 203 mm.
Strength Deck — The strength deck is the uppermost deck which is incorporated into and forms an integral part of the longitudinal girder within the half-length amidships.
Depth to Strength Deck (D<sub>s</sub>) — The depth to strength deck is the vertical distance in metres amidships from the top of the keel to the top of the strength deck beam at side.
Draught (d) — The draught is the vertical distance in metres amidships from the top of the keel to the centre of the disc.
	- **(b)** Longitudinal Modulus — The longitudinal modulus I/y is the moment of inertia I of the midship section about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the top of the strength deck beam at side, calculated in way of openings but without deductions for rivet holes. Areas are measured in square centimetres and distances in metres.
Below the strength deck, all continuous longitudinal members other than such parts of the under deck girders as are required entirely for supporting purposes are included. Above the strength deck, the gunwale angle bar and the extension of the sheerstrake are the only members included.The required longitudinal modulus for effective material is expressed by the formula f.d.B., where f is the factor obtained from the following table:

	- **(c)** Frame — For the purpose of the frame modulus, the frame is regarded as composed of a frame angle and a reverse angle each of the same size and thickness.
		- Frame Modulus — The Modulus I/y of the midship
frame below the lowest tier of beams is the moment of inertia I of the frame section about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the extremity of the frame section, calculated without deduction for rivet and bolt holes. The modulus is measured in centimetre units.The required frame modulus is expressed by the formula:


```
[s(d - t) (f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub>)] / 1 000
```
where 
- **s ** is the frame spacing in metres;
- **t ** is the vertical distance in metres measured at amidships from the top of the keel to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (*see* Figure 4); where there is no double bottom, t is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side;
- **f** <sub>1</sub>is a coefficient depending on H, which, in ships fitted with double bottoms, is the vertical distance in metres from the middle of the beam bracket of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (*see* Figure 4). Where there is no double bottom, H is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side. Where the frame obtains additional strength from the form of the ship, due allowance is made in the value of f<sub>1</sub>;
- **f** <sub>2</sub>is a coefficient depending on K, which is the vertical distance in metres from the top of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point 2.29 m above the freeboard deck at side, or, if there is a superstructure, to a point 3.81 m above the freeboard deck at side (*see* Figure 4).

## sheer

**46** 

- **(1)** The sheer shall be measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line at amidships.

- **(2)** In ships designed to trim by the stern in service, the sheer may be measured in relation to the load line, provided an additional mark is placed at 0.25L forward of amidships to indicate the assigned load line. This mark is to be similar to the load line disc amidships.

- **(3)** In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures, the sheer shall be measured at the freeboard deck.

- **(4)** In ships with topsides of unusual form in which there is a step or break in the topsides, the sheer shall be considered in relation to the equivalent depth amidship.

- **(5)** In ships with a superstructure of standard height that extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer shall be measured at the superstructure deck; where the height exceeds the standard, the sheer may be considered in relation to the standard height.

- **(6)** Where a superstructure is intact or access openings in its enclosing bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, and the superstructure deck has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck shall not be taken into account.


**47** The ordinates (in millimetres) of the standard sheer profile are given in the following table, where L is the number of metres in the length of the ship:

**48** 

- **(1)** Where the sheer profile differs from the standard, the seven ordinates of each profile shall be multiplied by the appropriate factors given in the table to section 47. The difference between the sums of the respective products, divided by 18, measures the deficiency or excess of sheer.

- **(2)** Where the after half of the sheer profile is greater than the standard and the forward half is less than the standard, no credit shall be allowed for the part in excess.

- **(3)** Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the standard and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than 75 per cent of the standard, credit shall be allowed for the part in excess; where the after part is less than 50 per cent of the standard, no credit shall be given for the excess sheer forward; where the after sheer is between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the standard, an intermediate allowance may be granted for excess sheer forward.


**49** The correction for variations from the standard sheer shall be the deficiency or excess of sheer determined in accordance with section 48 multiplied by
```
0.75 - S/2L,
```
where 
- **S ** is the total length of superstructure, as defined in subsection 1(9).


**50** Where the sheer is less than the standard, the correction for deficiency in sheer, determined in accordance with section 48 shall be added to the freeboard.


**51** In flush deck ships and in ships where an enclosed superstructure covers 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the correction for excess of sheer, determined in accordance with section 49 shall be deducted from the freeboard; in ships with detached superstructures, where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no deduction shall be made from the freeboard; where an enclosed superstructure covers less than 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the deduction shall be obtained by interpolation; the maximum deduction for excess sheer shall be 125 mm at 100 m length of ship and shall increase at the rate of 125 mm for each additional 100 m in the length of the ship.







## round of beam

**52** The standard round of beam of the freeboard deck is one-fiftieth of the breadth of the ship.


**53** Where the round of beam of the freeboard deck is greater or less than the standard, the freeboard shall be decreased or increased respectively by one-fourth of the difference between the actual and the standard round of beam, multiplied by the proportion of the length of the freeboard deck not covered by enclosed superstructures; twice the standard round of beam is the maximum for which allowance may be given.







## minimum freeboards

**54** The minimum freeboard in Summer shall be the freeboard derived from the table set out in section 58, after correction for departures from the standards and after deduction for superstructures in accordance with this Part, so however that if the freeboard, calculated in accordance with this Part but before the correction required by Note (f) appended to the table is made, be less than 50 mm, 50 mm shall be substituted therefor.


**55** The minimum freeboard in the Tropical Zone shall be the freeboard obtained by a deduction from the Summer freeboard of one forty-eighth of the Summer draught measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the load line disc, so however that if the freeboard, calculated in accordance with this Part but before the correction required by Note (f) appended to the table set out in section 58 is made, be less than 50 mm, 50 mm shall be substituted therefor.


**56** 

- **(1)** The minimum freeboard in Winter shall be the freeboard obtained by an addition to the Summer freeboard of one forty-eighth of the Summer draught, measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the load line disc.

- **(2)** The minimum Winter North Atlantic freeboard for steamships not exceeding 100.6 m in length shall be the Winter freeboard plus 50 mm; for steamships over 100.6 m in length the minimum Winter North Atlantic freeboard shall be the Winter freeboard.


**57** 

- **(1)** The amount of the fresh water allowance for a ship in fresh water of unit density is Δ/ 4 T expressed in millimetres
where Δ = displacement in salt water in tonnes at the Summer load waterline, and
T = tonnes per centimetre immersion in salt water at the Summer load waterline.

- **(2)** Where the displacement at the Summer load waterline cannot be certified, the deduction shall be one forty-eighth of the Summer draught measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the disc.


**58** The basic minimum Summer freeboards for steamships are as set out in the following table:

**PART III** 
## Calculation of Freeboards for Sailing Ships

**59** Subject to sections 60 to 66, the freeboards for sailing ships shall be calculated in the same manner as the freeboards for steamships are calculated from the freeboard table for steamships contained in section 58, but modified by substituting the table set out in section 65 for the table set out in section 58.


**60** 

- **(1)** In sailing ships having a greater rise of floor than 125 mm per metre, the vertical distance from the top of keel shall be reduced by half the difference between the total rise of floor at the half-breadth of the ship and the total rise at 125 mm per metre; 208 mm per metre of half-breadth is the maximum rate of rise for which a deduction may be made.

- **(2)** Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character or thick garboards are fitted, the depth shall be measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

- **(3)** The depth used with the freeboard table shall be taken as not less than L/12.


**61** The coefficient of fineness (c) used with the freeboard table contained in section 65 shall be taken as not less than 0.62 and not greater than 0.72.


**62** In wood ships the Assigning Authority shall be satisfied as to the efficiency of the construction and closing arrangements of superstructures for which deductions are made from the freeboard.


**63** Where the effective length of superstructure is 1.0L, the deduction from the freeboard shall be 78 mm at 25 m length of ship, and 707 mm at 100 m length and over; deductions at intermediate lengths shall be obtained by interpolation; where the total effective length of superstructures is less than 1.0L, the deduction shall be a percentage obtained from the following table:
