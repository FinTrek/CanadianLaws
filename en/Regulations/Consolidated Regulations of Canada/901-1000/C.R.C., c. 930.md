### **SCHEDULE I / ** ANNEXE I
**(Section 6 / *article 6*)**
## Guard Template / Gabarit de la Garde
> Image: Illustration depicting specifications and measurements for a guard template for testing pacifiers. The guard template is a rectangular aluminum plate, 4 inches long, 2.70 inches wide, and 0.125 inches thick. There is an opening in the middle formed by a circle, with two triangles opposed at their summits, in the shape of a bowtie. The length of the opening, from one triangle base to the other, is 3 inches.




### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(Section 6)**
## Testing Procedure
**1** Hold the nipple of the pacifier in a fixed position. Apply a load 10 ± 0.25 pounds in the plane of the axis of the nipple to the handle of the pacifier at a rate of 1 ± 0.25 pounds per second and maintain the final load for 10 ± 0.5 seconds.


**2** Hold the guard or shield of the pacifier in a fixed position. Apply a load of 10 ± 0.25 pounds in the plane normal to the axis of the nipple to the handle of the pacifier at a rate of 1 ± 0.25 pounds per second and maintain the final load for 10 ± 0.5 seconds.


**3** Repeat the procedure described in section 2 with the load applied to the nipple of the pacifier.


**4** Immerse the pacifier in boiling water for 10 ± 0.5 minutes. Remove the pacifier from the boiling water and allow to cool in air at 70 ± 5 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 ± 0.5 minutes. Repeat the tests described in sections 1, 2 and 3.


**5** Repeat the entire procedure described in section 4 nine times.





### **SCHEDULE III** 
**(Clause 6(b)(iii)(B))**
## Small Parts Cylinder
> Image: Illustration depicting measurements for a small parts cylinder. The small parts cylinder is a hollow cylinder with an inner diameter of 31.7 mm. A plate (or similar device) is placed inside the cylinder at a 45 degree angle such that the minimum depth of the cylinder is 25.4 mm and the maximum depth of the cylinder is 57.1 mm. No specifications are provided for the wall or floor thickness of the cylinder.

Notes:

**–** Not to scale
