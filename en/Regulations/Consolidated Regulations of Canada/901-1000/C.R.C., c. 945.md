**300** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of paragraphs 32.1(3)(b) and 60(a) of the Act, where an annuity is paid under a contract (other than an income-averaging annuity contract or an annuity contract purchased pursuant to a deferred profit sharing plan or pursuant to a plan referred to in subsection 147(15) of the Act as a “revoked plan”) at a particular time, that part of the annuity payment determined in prescribed manner to be a return of capital is that proportion of a taxpayer’s interest in the annuity payment that the adjusted purchase price of the taxpayer’s interest in the contract at that particular time is of his interest, immediately before the commencement under the contract of payments to which paragraph 56(1)(d) of the Act applies, in the total of the payments
	- **(a)** to be made under the contract, in the case of a contract for a term of years certain; or
	- **(b)** expected to be made under the contract, in the case of a contract under which the continuation of the payments depends in whole or in part on the survival of an individual.

- **(1.1)** For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), “annuity payment” does not include any portion of a payment under a contract the amount of which cannot be reasonably determined immediately before the commencement of payments under the contract except where the payment of such portion cannot be so determined because the continuation of the annuity payments under the contract depends in whole or in part on the survival of an individual.

	- **(a)** where the continuance of the annuity payments under any contract depends in whole or in part on the survival of an individual, the total of the payments expected to be made under the contract
		- **(i)** shall, in the case of a contract that provides for equal payments and does not provide for a guaranteed period of payment, be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate of the annuity payments expected to be received throughout a year under the contract by the complete expectations of life using the table of mortality known as the 1971 Individual Annuity Mortality Table as published in Volume XXIII of the Transactions of the Society of Actuaries, or
		- **(ii)** shall, in any other case, be calculated in accordance with subparagraph (i) with such modifications as the circumstances may require;

	- **(c)** where the continuance of the annual payments under any contract depends on the survival of a person, the age of that person on any date as of which a calculation is being made shall be determined by subtracting the calendar year of his birth from the calendar year in which such date occurs; and
	- **(d)** where the continuance of the annual payments under any contract depends on the survival of a person, and where, in the event of the death of that person before the annual payments aggregate a stated sum, the contract provides that the unpaid balance of the stated sum shall be paid, either in a lump sum or instalments, then, for the purpose of determining the expected term of the contract, the contract shall be deemed to provide for the continuance of the payments thereunder for a minimum term certain equal to the nearest integral number of years required to complete the payment of the stated sum.
	- **(e)** [Repealed, SOR/83-865, s. 1]

- **(3)** Where
	- **(a)** an annuity contract is a life annuity contract entered into before November 17, 1978 under which the annuity payments commence on the death of an individual,

	- **(b)** an annuity contract (other than an annuity contract described in paragraph (a)) is
		- **(i)** a life annuity contract entered into before October 23, 1968, or
		- **(ii)** any other annuity contract entered into before January 4, 1968,
under which the annuity payments commence
		- **(iii)** on the expiration of a term of years, and
		- **(iv)** before the later of January 1, 1970 and the tax anniversary date of the annuity contract,
the adjusted purchase price of a taxpayer’s interest in the annuity contract shall be

	- **(d)** if no lump sum described in paragraph (c) is provided for in the contract, the sum ascertainable from the contract as the present value of the annuity at the date the annuity payments commence; and
	- **(e)** if no lump sum described in paragraph (c) is provided for in the contract and no sum is ascertainable under paragraph (d),
		- **(i)** in the case of a contract issued under the [Government Annuities Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20G-6.md), the premiums paid, accumulated with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum to the date the annuity payments commence, and
		- **(ii)** in the case of any other contract, the present value of the annuity payments at the date on which payments under the contract commence, computed by applying
			- **(A)** a rate of interest of four per cent per annum where the payments commence before 1972 and 5 1/2 per cent per annum where the payments commence after 1971, and
			- **(B)** the provisions of subsection (2) where the payments depend on the survival of a person.

- **(4)** Where an annuity contract would be described in paragraph (3)(b) if the reference in subparagraph (iv) thereof to “before the later of” were read as a reference to “on or after the later of”, the adjusted purchase price of a taxpayer’s interest in the annuity contract at a particular time shall be the greater of
	- **(a)** the aggregate of
		- **(i)** the amount that would be determined in respect of that interest under paragraph (3)(c), (d) or (e), as the case may be, if the date referred to therein was the tax anniversary date of the contract and not the date the annuity payments commence, and
		- **(ii)** the adjusted purchase price that would be determined in respect of that interest if the words “and after the tax anniversary date” were inserted in each of subparagraphs 148(9)(a)(i) to (iii.1) and (vi) of the Act immediately following the words “before that time” in each of those subparagraphs; and
	- **(b)** the amount determined under paragraph (2)(b) in respect of that interest.

			- **(B)** is an annuitant under the contract, and
			- **(C)** throughout the taxation year, dealt at arm’s length with the issuer,
		- **(iv)** the terms and conditions of which require that, from the time the contract meets the requirements of this paragraph,
			- **(A)** all payments made out of the contract be equal annuity payments made at regular intervals but not less frequently than annually, subject to the holder’s right to vary the frequency and quantum of payments to be made out of the contract in any taxation year without altering the present value at the beginning of the year of the total payments to be made in that year out of the contract,
			- **(B)** the annuity payments thereunder continue for a fixed term or
				- **(I)** if the holder is an individual (other than a trust), for the life of the first holder or until the day of the later of the death of the first holder and the death of any of the spouse, common-law partner, former spouse, former common-law partner, brothers and sisters (in this subparagraph referred to as “the survivor”) of the first holder, or

- **(2)** Notwithstanding subsection (1), an annuity contract shall not fail to be a prescribed annuity contract by reason that
	- **(a)** where the contract provides for a joint and last survivor annuity or is held jointly, the terms and conditions thereof provide that there will be a decrease in the amount of the annuity payments to be made under the contract from the time of death of one of the annuitants thereunder;

### Unallocated Income Accrued Before 1982


**305** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of section 12.2 and paragraph 56(1)(d.1) of the Act, the amount at any time of “unallocated income accrued in respect of the interest before 1982, as determined in prescribed manner”, in respect of a taxpayer’s interest in an annuity contract (other than an interest last acquired after December 1, 1982) or in a life insurance policy referred to in subsection (3), means the amount, if any, by which
	- **(a)** the accumulating fund at December 31, 1981 in respect of the interest
exceeds the aggregate of
	- **(b)** his adjusted cost basis (within the meaning assigned by paragraph 148(9)(a) of the Act) at December 31, 1981 in respect of the interest; and
	- **(c)** that proportion of the amount, if any, by which the amount determined under paragraph (a) exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (b) that
		- **(i)** the aggregate of all amounts each of which is the amount of an annuity payment received before that time in respect of the interest
is of
		- **(ii)** the taxpayer’s interest, immediately before the commencement of payments under the contract, in the total of the annuity payments
			- **(A)** to be made under the contract, in the case of a contract for a term of years certain, or
			- **(B)** expected to be made under the contract, in the case of a contract under which the continuation of the payments depends in whole or in part on the survival of an individual.

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), “annuity payment” does not include any portion of a payment under a contract the amount of which cannot be reasonably determined immediately before the commencement of payments under the contract except where such portion cannot be so determined because the continuation of the annuity payments under the contract depends in whole or in part on the survival of an individual.

- **(3)** For the purposes of this section, an interest in an annuity contract to which subsection 12.2(9) of the Act applies shall be deemed to be a continuation of the interest in the life insurance policy in respect of which it was issued.

### Exempt Policies


**306** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of this Part and subsection 12.2(11) of the Act, ***exempt policy*** at any time means a life insurance policy (other than an annuity contract or a deposit administration fund policy) in respect of which the following conditions are met at that time:
	- **(a)** if that time is a policy anniversary of the policy, the accumulating fund of the policy at that time (determined without regard to any policy loan) does not exceed the total of the accumulating funds at that time of the exemption test policies issued at or before that time in respect of the policy;
	- **(b)** assuming that the terms and conditions of the policy do not change from those in effect on the last policy anniversary of the policy at or before that time and, where necessary, making reasonable assumptions about all other factors (including, in the case of a participating life insurance policy within the meaning assigned by subsection 138(12) of the Act, the assumption that the amounts of dividends paid will be as shown in the dividend scale), it is reasonable to expect that the condition in paragraph (a) will be met on each policy anniversary of the policy on which the policy could remain in force after that time and before the date determined under subparagraph (3)(d)(ii) with respect to the exemption test policies issued in respect of the policy;
	- **(c)** the condition in paragraph (a) was met on all policy anniversaries of the policy before that time; and
	- **(d)** the condition in paragraph (b) was met at all times on and after the first policy anniversary of the policy and before that time.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), a life insurance policy that is an exempt policy on its first policy anniversary shall be deemed to have been an exempt policy from the time of its issue until that anniversary.

- **(3)** For the purposes of this section and section 307, a separate exemption test policy shall be deemed to have been issued to a policyholder in respect of a life insurance policy
	- **(a)** on the date of issue of the life insurance policy, and
	- **(b)** on each policy anniversary of the life insurance policy where the amount of the benefit on death thereunder exceeds 108 per cent of the amount of the benefit on death thereunder on the later of the date of its issue and the date of its preceding anniversary, if any,
and, for the purpose of determining whether the accumulating fund of the life insurance policy on any particular policy anniversary meets the condition in paragraph (1)(a), each such exemption test policy shall be deemed
	- **(c)** to have a benefit on death that is uniform throughout the term of the exemption test policy and equal to
		- **(i)** where the exemption test policy is the first such policy issued in respect of the life insurance policy, the amount on that policy anniversary of the benefit on death of the life insurance policy less the total of all amounts each of which is the amount on that policy anniversary of the benefit on death of another exemption test policy issued on or before that policy anniversary in respect of the life insurance policy, and
		- **(ii)** in any other case, the amount by which the benefit on death of the life insurance policy on the date the exemption test policy was issued exceeds 108 per cent of the amount of the benefit on death of the life insurance policy on the later of the date of issue of the life insurance policy and the date of its preceding policy anniversary, if any;
	- **(d)** to pay the amount of its benefit on death on the earlier of
		- **(i)** the date of death of the person whose life is insured under the life insurance policy, and
		- **(ii)** the later of
			- **(A)** ten years after the date of issue of the life insurance policy, and
			- **(B)** the date that the person whose life is insured would, if he survived, attain the age of 85 years; and
	- **(e)** to be a life insurance policy in Canada issued by a life insurer that carried on its life insurance business in Canada.

- **(4)** Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3),
	- **(a)** where at any particular time the amount of the benefit on death of a life insurance policy is reduced, an amount equal to such reduction (such amount is in this paragraph referred to as “the reduction”) shall be applied at that time to reduce the amount of the benefit on death of exemption test policies issued before that time in respect of the life insurance policy (other than the exemption test policy issued in respect thereof pursuant to paragraph (3)(a)), in the order in which the dates of their issuance are proximate to the particular time, by an amount equal to the lesser of
		- **(i)** the portion, if any, of the reduction not applied to reduce the benefit on death of one or more other such exemption test policies, and
		- **(ii)** the amount, immediately before that time, of the benefit on death of the relevant exemption test policy;
	- **(b)** where on the tenth or on any subsequent policy anniversary of a life insurance policy, the accumulating fund thereof (computed without regard to any policy loan then outstanding in respect of the policy) exceeds 250 per cent of the accumulating fund thereof on its third preceding policy anniversary (computed without regard to any policy loan then outstanding in respect of the policy), each exemption test policy deemed by subsection (3) to have been issued before that time in respect of the life insurance policy shall be deemed to have been issued on the later of the date of that third preceding policy anniversary and the date on which it was deemed by subsection (3) to have been issued; and
	- **(c)** where at one or more times after December 1, 1982
		- **(i)** a prescribed premium has been paid by a taxpayer in respect of an interest in a life insurance policy (other than an annuity contract or a deposit administration fund policy) last acquired on or before that date, or
		- **(ii)** an interest in a life insurance policy (other than an annuity contract or a deposit administration fund policy) issued on or before that date has been acquired by a taxpayer from the person who held the interest continuously since that date,
the policy shall be deemed to have been an exempt policy from the date of its issue until the earliest of those times that occurred after December 1, 1982; and
	- **(d)** a life insurance policy that ceases to be an exempt policy (other than by reason of its conversion into an annuity contract) on a policy anniversary shall be deemed to be an exempt policy on that anniversary
		- **(i)** if, had that anniversary occurred 60 days after the date on which it did in fact occur, the policy would have been an exempt policy on that later date, or
		- **(ii)** if the person whose life is insured under the policy dies on that anniversary or within 60 days thereafter.

### Accumulating Funds


**307** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of this Part and section 12.2, paragraph 56(1)(d.1) and section 148 of the Act, ***accumulating fund*** at any particular time means,
	- **(a)** in respect of a taxpayer’s interest in an annuity contract (other than a contract issued by a life insurer), the amount that is the greater of
		- **(i)** the amount, if any, by which the cash surrender value of his interest at that time exceeds the amount payable, if any, in respect of a loan outstanding at that time made under the contract in respect of the interest, and
		- **(ii)** the amount, if any, by which
			- **(A)** the present value at that time of future payments to be made out of the contract in respect of his interestexceeds the aggregate of
			- **(B)** the present value at that time of future premiums to be paid under the contract in respect of his interest, and
			- **(C)** the amount payable, if any, in respect of a loan outstanding at that time, made under the contract in respect of his interest;
	- **(b)** in respect of a taxpayer’s interest in a life insurance policy (other than an exemption test policy or an annuity contract to which paragraph (1)(a) applies), the product obtained when,
		- **(i)** where the policy is not a deposit administration fund policy and the particular time is immediately after the death of any person on whose life the life insurance policy is issued or effected, the aggregate of the maximum amounts that could be determined by the life insurer immediately before the death in respect of the policy under paragraph 1401(1)(c) and subparagraph 1401(1)(d)(i) if the mortality rates used were adjusted to reflect the assumption that the death would occur at the time and in the manner that it did occur, and
		- **(ii)** in any other case, the maximum amount that could be determined at that particular time by the life insurer under paragraph 1401(1)(a), computed as though there were only one deposit administration fund policy, or under paragraph 1401(1)(c), as the case may be, in respect of the policy
is multiplied by
		- **(iii)** the taxpayer’s proportionate interest in the policy,
assuming for the purposes of this paragraph that the life insurer carried on its life insurance business in Canada, its taxation year ended at the particular time and the policy was a life insurance policy in Canada; and
	- **(c)** in respect of an exemption test policy,
		- **(i)** where the policy was issued at least 20 years before the particular time, the amount that would be determined at that particular time by the life insurer under clause 1401(1)(c)(ii)(A) in respect of the policy if the insurer’s taxation year ended at that particular time, and
		- **(ii)** in any other case, the product obtained when the amount that would be determined under subparagraph (i) in respect of the policy on its twentieth policy anniversary is multiplied by the quotient obtained when the number of years since the policy was issued is divided by 20.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), when computing the accumulating fund of an interest described in
	- **(a)** paragraph (1)(a), the amounts determined under clauses (1)(a)(ii)(A) and (B) shall be computed using,
		- **(i)** where an interest rate for a period used by the issuer when the contract was issued in determining the terms of the contract was less than any rate so used for a subsequent period, the single rate that would, if it applied for each period, have produced the same terms, and
		- **(ii)** in any other case, the rates used by the issuer when the contract was issued in determining the terms of the contract;
	- **(b)** paragraph (1)(b), where an interest rate used for a period by a life insurer in computing the relevant amounts in paragraph 1403(1)(a) or (b) is determined under paragraph 1403(1)(c), (d) or (e), as the case may be, and that rate is less than an interest rate so determined for a subsequent period, the single rate that could, if it applied for each period, have been used in determining the premiums for the policy shall be used; and
	- **(c)** paragraph (1)(c),
		- **(i)** the rates of interest and mortality used and the age of the person whose life is insured shall be the same as those used in computing the amounts described in paragraph 1403(1)(a) or (b) in respect of the life insurance policy in respect of which the exemption test policy was issued except that
			- **(A)** where the life insurance policy is one to which paragraph 1403(1)(e) applies and the amount determined under subparagraph 1401(1)(c)(i) in respect of that policy is greater than the amount determined under subparagraph 1401(1)(c)(ii) in respect thereof, the rates of interest and mortality used may be those used in computing the cash surrender values of that policy, and
			- **(B)** where an interest rate for a period otherwise determined under this subparagraph in respect of that interest is less than an interest rate so determined for a subsequent period, the single rate that could, if it applied for each period, have been used in determining the premiums for the life insurance policy shall be used, and
		- **(ii)** notwithstanding subparagraph (i),
			- **(A)** where the rates referred to in subparagraph (i) do not exist, the minimum guaranteed rates of interest used under the life insurance policy to determine cash surrender values and the rates of mortality under the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, as published in Volume X of the Transactions of the Society of Actuaries, relevant to the person whose life is insured under the life insurance policy shall be used, or
			- **(B)** where, in respect of the life insurance policy in respect of which the exemption test policy was issued, the period over which the amount determined under clause 1401(1)(c)(ii)(A) does not extend to the date determined under subparagraph 306(3)(d)(ii), the weighted arithmetic mean of the interest rates used to determine such amount shall be used for the period that is after that period and before that date.

- **(3)** Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(c),
	- **(a)** in the case of a life insurance policy issued after April 30, 1985, no rate of interest used for the purpose of determining the accumulating fund in respect of an exemption test policy issued in respect thereof shall be less than 4 per cent per annum; and
	- **(b)** in the case of a life insurance policy issued before May 1, 1985, no rate of interest used for the purpose of determining the accumulating fund in respect of an exemption test policy issued in respect thereof shall be less than 3 per cent per annum.

- **(4)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c),
	- **(a)** where on the date of issue of an exemption test policy the person whose life is insured has attained the age of 75 years, the references in paragraph (1)(c) to “20” and “twentieth” shall be read as references to “10” and “tenth” respectively; and
	- **(b)** where on the date of issue of an exemption test policy the person whose life is insured has attained the age of 66 years but not the age of 75 years, the references in paragraph (1)(c) to “20” and “twentieth” shall be read as references to
		- **(i)** the number obtained when the number of years by which the age of the person whose life is insured exceeds 65 years is subtracted from 20, and
		- **(ii)** the adjectival form of the number obtained by performing the computation described in subparagraph (i), respectively.

- **(5)** In this section, any amount determined by reference to section 1401 shall be determined
	- **(a)** without regard to section 1402;
	- **(b)** as if each reference therein to the term “policy loan” were read as if that term had the meaning assigned by paragraph 148(9)(e) of the Act; and
	- **(c)** as if clauses 1401(1)(c)(i)(B) and 1401(1)(c)(ii)(C) were read without reference to the expression “or the interest thereon that has accrued to the insurer at the end of the year”.

### Net Cost of Pure Insurance and Mortality Gains and Losses


**308** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of subparagraph 20(1)(e.2)(ii) and paragraph (a) of the description of L in the definition ***adjusted cost basis*** in subsection 148(9) of the Act, the net cost of pure insurance for a year in respect of a taxpayer’s interest in a life insurance policy is the product obtained when the probability, computed on the basis of the rates of mortality under the 1969-75 mortality tables of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries published in Volume XVI of the Proceedings of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries or on the basis described in subsection (1.1), that a person who has the same relevant characteristics as the person whose life is insured will die in the year is multiplied by the amount by which
	- **(a)** the benefit on death in respect of the taxpayer’s interest at the end of the year
exceeds
	- **(b)** the accumulating fund (determined without regard to any policy loan outstanding) in respect of the taxpayer’s interest in the policy at the end of the year or the cash surrender value of such interest at the end of the year, depending on the method regularly followed by the life insurer in computing net cost of pure insurance.

- **(1.1)** Where premiums for a particular class of life insurance policy offered by a life insurer do not depend directly on smoking or sex classification, the probability referred to in subsection (1) may be determined using rates of mortality otherwise determined provided that for each age for such class of life insurance policy, the expected value of the aggregate net cost of pure insurance, calculated using such rates of mortality, is equal to the expected value of the aggregate net cost of pure insurance, calculated using the rates of mortality under the 1969-75 mortality tables of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries published in Volume XVI of the Proceedings of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (4), for the purposes of this section and subparagraph 148(9)(a)(v.1) of the Act, a ***mortality gain*** immediately before the end of any calendar year after 1982 in respect of a taxpayer’s interest in a life annuity contract means such reasonable amount in respect of his interest therein at that time that the life insurer determines to be the increase to the accumulating fund in respect of the interest that occurred during that year as a consequence of the survival to the end of the year of one or more of the annuitants thereunder.

- **(3)** Subject to subsection (4), for the purposes of this section and subparagraph 148(9)(a)(xi) of the Act, a ***mortality loss*** immediately before a particular time after 1982 in respect of an interest in a life annuity contract disposed of immediately after that particular time as a consequence of the death of an annuitant thereunder means such reasonable amount that the life insurer determines to be the decrease, as a consequence of the death, in the accumulating fund in respect of the interest assuming that, in determining such decrease, the accumulating fund immediately after the death is determined in the manner described in subparagraph 307(1)(b)(i).

- **(4)** In determining an amount for a year in respect of an interest in a life annuity contract under subsection (2) or (3), the expected value of the mortality gains in respect of the interest for the year shall be equal to the expected value of the mortality losses in respect of the interest for the year and the mortality rates for the year used in computing those expected values shall be those that would be relevant to the interest and that are specified under such of paragraphs 1403(1)(c), (d) and (e) as are applicable.

### Prescribed Premiums and Prescribed Increases


**309** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of subsections 12.2(9) and 89(2) of the Act, section 306 and this section, a premium at any time under a life insurance policy is a “prescribed premium” if the total amount of one or more premiums paid at that time under the policy exceeds the amount of premium that, under the policy, was scheduled to be paid at that time and that was fixed and determined on or before December 1, 1982, adjusted for such of the following transactions and events that have occurred after that date in respect of the policy:
	- **(a)** a change in underwriting class;
	- **(b)** a change in premium due to a change in frequency of premium payments within a year that does not alter the present value, at the beginning of the year, of the total premiums to be paid under the policy in the year;

	- **(c)** the present value of the premiums at the date of issue of the policy
shall equal
	- **(d)** the aggregate of the present values of the benefits, outlays and expenses referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b),
and the increased rate of interest shall be deemed to have been used by the insurer in determining the premiums for policy.

- **(4)** For the purposes of subsection (3), a “present value” referred to in that subsection shall be computed by using the rates of mortality and other probabilities used by the insurer in determining its premiums, after mixing any revision required by subsection (2).

- **(5)** For the purposes of subsection (1), where a record of the rate of interest or mortality used by an insurer in determining the premiums for a policy is not available,
	- **(a)** the insurer may, if the policy was issued before 1978, make a reasonable estimate of the rate; and
	- **(b)** the Minister, on the advice of the Superintendant of Insurance for Canada, may
		- **(i)** if the policy was issued before 1978 and the insurer has not made the estimate referred to in paragraph (a), or
		- **(ii)** if the policy was issued after 1977,
make a reasonable estimate of the rate.

- **(6)** Notwithstanding paragraph 1401(1)(c), a life insurer in computing its income for a taxation year may, in respect of any class of life insurance policies issued before its 1988 taxation year, other than policies referred to in paragraph 1401(1)(a) or (b), use a method of approximation to convert the reserve in respect of such policies reported by the insurer in its annual report to the relevant authority for the year to an amount that is a reasonable estimate of the amount that would otherwise be determined for such policies under paragraph 1401(1)(c), provided that that method of approximation is acceptable to the Minister on the advice of the relevant authority.

- **(7)** For the purpose of subsection (1) and notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where
	- **(a)** an individual annuity contract was issued prior to 1969 by a life insurer, or
	- **(b)** a benefit was purchased prior to 1969 under a group annuity contract issued by a life insurer, and
the contract
	- **(c)** is a policy in respect of which the provisions of paragraph 1401(1)(c) as it read in its application to the insurer’s 1977 taxation year applied,
the rates of interest and mortality and by the insurer in computing its reserve for the policy under that paragraph for its 1977 taxation year shall be used by the insurer in respect of that policy.

- **(8)** For the purposes of subsection (1), where
	- **(a)** in a taxation year of an insurer, there has been a disposition to the insurer by another person with whom the insurer was dealing at arm’s length in respect of which subsection 138(11.92) of the Act applied,
	- **(b)** as a result of the disposition, the insurer assumed obligations under life insurance policies (in this subsection referred to as the “transferred policies”) in respect of which an amount may be claimed by the insurer as a reserve under paragraph 1401(1)(c) for the taxation year,
	- **(c)** the amount, if any, by which
		- **(i)** the aggregate of all amounts received or receivable by the insurer from the other person in respect of the transferred policies referred to in paragraph (b)
exceeds
		- **(ii)** the aggregate of all amounts paid or payable by the insurer to the other person in respect of commissions in respect of the amounts referred to in subparagraph (i)
exceeds the total of the maximum amounts that may be claimed by the insurer as a reserve under paragraph 1401(1)(c) (determined without reference to this subsection) in respect of the transferred policies for the taxation year, and
	- **(d)** the amount determined under paragraph (c) (in this subsection referred to as “reserve deficiency”) can reasonably be attributed to the fact that the rates of interest or mortality used by the issuer of the transferred policies in determining the cash surrender values or premiums under such policies are no longer reasonable in the circumstances,
the Minister, on the request of the insurer and with the advice of the relevant authority, may make such revision to the rates of interest or mortality to eliminate all or any part of that reserve deficiency, and those revised rates shall be deemed to have been used by the issuer of the transferred policies in determining the cash surrender value or premiums under the policies.

### Interpretation



#### Taxation Years for Individuals in Business


**1703** 

- **(1)** Where a taxpayer is an individual and his income for the taxation year includes income from a business the fiscal period of which does not coincide with the calendar year, in respect of depreciable properties acquired for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the business, a reference in this Part to
	- **(a)** “the taxation year” shall be deemed to be a reference to the fiscal period of the business; and
	- **(b)** “the end of the taxation year” shall be deemed to be a reference to the end of the fiscal period of the business.

#### Depreciable Cost


- **(2)** In this Part, ***depreciable cost*** to a taxpayer of property means, except as otherwise provided, the actual cost of the property to the taxpayer or the amount at which he is deemed under subsection 13(7) of the Act to have acquired the property, as the case may be.

- **(3)** Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, in the case of property the cost of which to a partnership has been determined under paragraph 20(5)(a) of the [Income Tax Application Rules](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%202%20(5th%20Supp.).md), the depreciable cost to the taxpayer of the property for the purposes of this Part shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the cost to the partnership of the particular property as determined under that paragraph.

#### Personal Use of Property


- **(4)** Where a taxpayer has, in a taxation year, regularly used a property in part for the purpose of gaining or producing income from farming or fishing and in part for a purpose other than gaining or producing income, the depreciable cost to the taxpayer of the property for the purposes of this Part is the proportion of the amount that would otherwise be the depreciable cost that the use regularly made of the property for the purpose of gaining or producing income from farming or fishing is of the whole use regularly made of the property.

#### Grants, Subsidies or Other Government Assistance


- **(5)** Where a taxpayer has received or is entitled to receive a grant, subsidy or other assistance from a government, municipality or other public authority in respect of or for the acquisition of property, the depreciable cost to the taxpayer of the property for the purposes of this Part is the amount that would otherwise be the depreciable cost minus the amount of the grant, subsidy or other assistance.

#### Transactions Not at Arm’s Length


- **(6)** Where property did belong to a person (in this subsection referred to as the “original owner”) and has, by one or more transactions between persons not dealing at arm’s length, become vested in a taxpayer, the depreciable cost to the taxpayer of the property for the purposes of this part is the lesser of
	- **(a)** the actual capital cost of the property to the taxpayer; and
	- **(b)** the amount by which the actual capital cost of the property to the original owner exceeds the aggregate of
		- **(i)** the total amount of depreciation for the property that, since the commencement of 1917, has been or should have been taken into account in accordance with the practice of the Department of National Revenue in ascertaining the income of the original owner and all intervening owners for the purposes of the Income War Tax Act or in ascertaining a loss for a year when there was no income under that Act,
		- **(ii)** any accumulated depreciation reserves that the original owner or an intervening owner had for the property at the commencement of 1917 and that were recognized by the Minister for the purposes of the Income War Tax Act, and
		- **(iii)** the aggregate of the deductions, if any, allowed under this Part in respect of the property to the original owner and all intervening owners.

#### Property Acquired From a Parent


- **(7)** Notwithstanding subsection (6), where depreciable property has been acquired by a taxpayer under such circumstances that the provisions of section 85H of the Act as it read in its application to the 1971 and prior taxation years are applicable for the determination of the capital cost of the property, the depreciable cost to the taxpayer of the property for the purposes of this Part is the capital cost as determined under that section.

#### Property Acquired by Gift


- **(8)** Subsection (6) does not apply in respect of property which a taxpayer has acquired by gift.

is of
	- **(b)** the surplus entitlement percentage immediately after that time of the corporation in respect of the issuing affiliate or other affiliate, as the case may be, determined on the assumption that the taxation year of the issuing affiliate or the other affiliate, as the case may be, that otherwise would have included that time had ended immediately after that time,

		- **(i)** each other foreign affiliate of the corporation in which the foreign affiliate had an equity percentage had immediately before that time paid a dividend equal to its net surplus in respect of the corporation immediately before the dividend was paid, and
		- **(ii)** any dividend referred to in subparagraph (i) that would be received by another foreign affiliate was received by such other foreign affiliate immediately before any such dividend that it would have paid,
that may reasonably be considered to relate to

	- **(b)** if any foreign affiliate of a corporation resident in Canada has issued shares of more than one class of its capital stock, the amount that would be paid as a dividend on the shares of any class is such portion of its net surplus as, in the circumstances, it might reasonably be expected to have paid on all the shares of that class.

- **(12)** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, for the purposes of determining under subsection (10) the net surplus of a foreign affiliate of a corporation resident in Canada in respect of the corporation at any time in a taxation year of the affiliate that would otherwise have included that time (in this subsection referred to as the “normal year”), the exempt earnings or loss and the taxable earnings or loss required to be included in computing the net surplus in respect of any taxation year of the affiliate that is assumed for the purposes of a provision of this section to have ended at that time shall be deemed to be that proportion of such amounts determined for the normal year that the number of days in the taxation year assumed to have ended at that time is of the number of days in the normal year.

- **(13)** For the purposes of the definition ***surplus entitlement percentage*** in subsection 95(1) of the Act and of this Part, the surplus entitlement percentage at any time of a corporation resident in Canada in respect of a particular foreign affiliate of the corporation is,
	- **(a)** where the particular affiliate and each corporation that is relevant to the determination of the corporation’s equity percentage in the particular affiliate have only one class of issued shares at that time, the percentage that is the corporation’s equity percentage in the particular affiliate at that time, and
	- **(b)** in any other case, the proportion of 100 that
		- **(i)** the aggregate of all amounts, each of which is the surplus entitlement at that time of a share owned by the corporation of the capital stock of a foreign affiliate of the corporation in respect of the particular foreign affiliate of the corporation
is of
		- **(ii)** the amount determined under paragraph (10)(b) to be the net surplus of the particular affiliate in respect of the corporation at that time,
except that where the amount determined under subparagraph (ii) is nil, the percentage determined under this paragraph shall be the corporation’s equity percentage in the particular affiliate at that time,
and, for the purposes of this subsection, ***equity percentage*** has the meaning that would be assigned by subsection 95(4) of the Act if the reference in paragraph (b) of the definition ***equity percentage*** in that subsection to “any corporation” were read as a reference to “any corporation other than a corporation resident in Canada”.

**7000** 

- **(1)** For the purpose of subsection 12(9) of the Act, each of the following debt obligations (other than a debt obligation that is an indexed debt obligation) in respect of which a taxpayer has at any time acquired an interest is a prescribed debt obligation:
	- **(a)** a particular debt obligation in respect of which no interest is stipulated to be payable in respect of its principal amount,
	- **(b)** a particular debt obligation in respect of which the proportion of the payments of principal to which the taxpayer is entitled is not equal to the proportion of the payments of interest to which he is entitled,
	- **(c)** a particular debt obligation, other than one described in paragraph (a) or (b), in respect of which it can be determined, at the time the taxpayer acquired the interest therein, that the maximum amount of interest payable thereon in a year ending after that time is less than the maximum amount of interest payable thereon in a subsequent year, and
	- **(d)** a particular debt obligation, other than one described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c), in respect of which the amount of interest to be paid in respect of any taxation year is, under the terms and conditions of the obligation, dependent on a contingency existing after the year,
and, for the purposes of this subsection, a debt obligation includes, for greater certainty, all of the issuer’s obligations to pay principal and interest under that obligation.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection 12(9) of the Act, the amount determined in prescribed manner that is deemed to accrue to a taxpayer as interest on a prescribed debt obligation in each taxation year during which he holds an interest in the obligation is,
	- **(a)** in the case of a prescribed debt obligation described in paragraph (1)(a), the amount of interest that would be determined in respect thereof if interest thereon for that year were computed on a compound interest basis using the maximum of all rates each of which is a rate computed
		- **(i)** in respect of each possible circumstance under which an interest of the taxpayer in the obligation could mature or be surrendered or retracted, and
		- **(ii)** using assumptions concerning the interest rate and compounding period that will result in a present value, at the date of purchase of the interest, of all the maximum payments thereunder, equal to the cost thereof to the taxpayer;
	- **(b)** in the case of a prescribed debt obligation described in paragraph (1)(b), the aggregate of all amounts each of which is the amount of interest that would be determined in respect of his interest in a payment under the obligation if interest thereon for that year were computed on a compound interest basis using the specified cost of his interest therein and the specified interest rate in respect of his total interest in the obligation, and for the purposes of this paragraph,
		- **(i)** the ***specified cost*** of his interest in a payment under the obligation is its present value at the date of purchase computed using the specified interest rate, and
		- **(ii)** the ***specified interest rate*** is the maximum of all rates each of which is a rate computed
			- **(A)** in respect of each possible circumstance under which an interest of the taxpayer in the obligation could mature or be surrendered or retracted, and

		- **(i)** the maximum amount of interest thereon in respect of the year, and
		- **(ii)** the maximum amount of interest that would be determined in respect thereof if interest thereon for that year were computed on a compound interest basis using the maximum of all rates each of which is a rate computed
			- **(A)** in respect of each possible circumstance under which an interest of the taxpayer in the obligation could mature or be surrendered or retracted, and
			- **(B)** using assumptions concerning the interest rate and compounding period that will result in a present value, at the date of issue of the obligation, of all the maximum payments thereunder, equal to its principal amount;
	- **(c.1)** in the case of a prescribed debt obligation described in paragraph (1)(c) for which
		- **(i)** the rate of interest stipulated to be payable in respect of each period throughout which the obligation is outstanding is fixed at the date of issue of the obligation, and
		- **(ii)** the stipulated rate of interest applicable at each time is not less than each stipulated rate of interest applicable before that time,
the amount of interest that would be determined in respect of the year if interest on the obligation for that year were computed on a compound interest basis using the maximum of all rates each of which is the compound interest rate that, for a particular assumption with respect to when the taxpayer’s interest in the obligation will mature or be surrendered or retracted, results in a present value (at the date the taxpayer acquires the interest in the obligation) of all payments under the obligation after the acquisition by the taxpayer of the taxpayer’s interest in the obligation equal to the principal amount of the obligation at the date of acquisition; and
	- **(d)** in the case of a prescribed debt obligation described in paragraph (1)(d), the maximum amount of interest thereon that could be payable thereunder in respect of that year.

- **(4)** For the purposes of this section, where

	- **(b)** at the time the obligation was issued (or, if later, at the time the conversion privilege or option was added or modified), circumstances could reasonably be foreseen under which the holder of the obligation would, by exercising the conversion privilege or option, acquire an interest in a debt obligation with a principal amount less than its fair market value at the time of acquisition,
the subsequent interest in any debt obligation acquired by the taxpayer by exercising the conversion privilege or option shall be considered to be a continuation of the first interest.

- **(5)** For the purposes of making the computations referred to in paragraphs (2)(a), (b), (c) and (c.1), the compounding period shall not exceed one year and any interest rate used shall be constant from the time of acquisition or issue, as the case may be, until the time of maturity, surrender or retraction.

		- **(i)** the total of all amounts each of which is the amount by which the amount payable in respect of the taxpayer’s interest in an indexed payment under the obligation (other than a payment that is an excluded payment with respect to the taxpayer for the year) has, because of a change in the purchasing power of money, increased over an inflation adjustment period of the obligation that ends in the year
exceeds the total of
		- **(ii)** that portion of the total, if any, determined under subparagraph (i) that is required, otherwise than by subsection 16(6) of the Act, to be included in computing the taxpayer’s income for the year or a preceding taxation year, and
		- **(iii)** the total of all amounts each of which is the amount by which the amount payable in respect of the taxpayer’s interest in an indexed payment under the obligation (other than a payment that is an excluded payment with respect to the taxpayer for the year) has, by reason of a change in the purchasing power of money, decreased over an inflation adjustment period of the obligation that ends in the year, and
	- **(b)** where the non-indexed debt obligation associated with the indexed debt obligation is an obligation that is described in any of paragraphs 7000(1)(a) to (d), the amount of interest that would be determined under subsection 7000(2) to accrue to the taxpayer in respect of the non-indexed debt obligation in the particular period that
		- **(i)** begins at the beginning of the first inflation adjustment period of the indexed debt obligation in respect of the taxpayer that ends in the year, and
		- **(ii)** ends at the end of the last inflation adjustment period of the indexed debt obligation in respect of the taxpayer that ends in the year

	- **(p)** where the amount of the individual’s lifetime retirement benefits depends on whether the individual is totally and permanently disabled at the time at which retirement benefits commence to be paid to the individual, the individual were not so disabled at that time; and
	- **(q)** where lifetime retirement benefits have commenced to be paid under the provision to the individual before the end of the particular year, benefits payable as a consequence of cost-of-living adjustments described in paragraph 8303(5)(k) were disregarded.

#### Optional Forms


- **(4)** Where the terms of a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan permit a member to elect to receive additional lifetime retirement benefits in lieu of benefits that would, in the absence of the election, be payable after the death of the member if the member dies after retirement benefits under the provision commence to be paid to the member, paragraph (3)(o) applies as if the following elections were not available to the member:
	- **(a)** an election to receive additional lifetime retirement benefits, not exceeding additional benefits determined on an actuarially equivalent basis, in lieu of all or any portion of a guarantee that retirement benefits will be paid for a minimum period of 10 years or less, and
	- **(b)** an election to receive additional lifetime retirement benefits in lieu of retirement benefits that would otherwise be payable to an individual who is a spouse or common-law partner or former spouse or common-law partner of the member for a period beginning after the death of the member and ending with the death of the individual, where
		- **(i)** the election may be made only if the life expectancy of the individual is significantly shorter than normal and has been so certified in writing by a medical doctor licensed to practise under the laws of a province or of the place where the individual resides, and
		- **(ii)** the additional benefits do not exceed additional benefits determined on an actuarially equivalent basis and on the assumption that the individual has a normal life expectancy.

#### Termination of Entitlement to Benefits


- **(5)** For the purposes of subsection (3), where an individual ceased in a calendar year to be entitled to all or part of the lifetime retirement benefits provided to the individual under a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan, the normalized pension of the individual under the provision at the end of the year shall be determined on the assumption that the individual continued to be entitled to those benefits immediately after the end of the year.

#### Defined Benefit Offset


- **(6)** Where the amount of lifetime retirement benefits provided under a particular defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan to a member of the plan depends on the amount of lifetime retirement benefits provided to the member under one or more other defined benefit provisions of registered pension plans, the benefit accrual of the member under the particular provision in respect of a calendar year is the amount, if any, by which
	- **(a)** the amount that would, but for this subsection, be the benefit accrual of the member under the particular provision in respect of the year if the benefits provided under the other provisions were provided under the particular provision
exceeds
	- **(b)** the amount that would be the benefit accrual of the member under the other provisions in respect of the year if the other provisions were a single provision.

#### Offset of Specified Multi-employer Plan Benefits


- **(7)** Where the amount of an individual’s lifetime retirement benefits under a defined benefit provision (in this subsection referred to as the “supplemental provision”) of a registered pension plan depends on the amount of benefits payable under a defined benefit provision of a specified multi-employer plan, the defined benefit provision of the specified multi-employer plan shall be deemed to be a money purchase provision for the purpose of determining the benefit accruals of the individual under the supplemental provision.

#### Transition Rule — Career Average Benefits


- **(8)** Where
	- **(a)** on March 27, 1988 lifetime retirement benefits under a defined benefit provision of a pension plan were determined as the greater of benefits computed on a career average basis and benefits computed on a final or best average earnings basis,
	- **(b)** the method for determining lifetime retirement benefits under the provision was not amended after March 27, 1988 and before the end of a particular calendar year, and
	- **(c)** it was reasonable to expect, on January 1, 1990, that the lifetime retirement benefits to be paid under the provision to at least 75 per cent of the members of the plan on that date (other than members to whom benefits do not accrue under the provision after that date) will be determined on a final or best average earnings basis,
at the option of the plan administrator, benefit accruals under the provision in respect of the particular year may, where the particular year is before 1992, be determined without regard to the career average formula.

#### Transition Rule — Benefit Rate Greater Than 2 Per Cent


- **(9)** Subject to subsection (6), where
	- **(a)** the amount of lifetime retirement benefits provided under a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan to a member of the plan is determined, in part, by multiplying the member’s remuneration (or a function of the member’s remuneration) by one or more benefit accrual rates, and
	- **(b)** the largest benefit accrual rate that may be applicable is greater than 2 per cent,
the member’s benefit accrual under the provision in respect of 1990 or 1991 is the lesser of
	- **(c)** the member’s benefit accrual otherwise determined, and
	- **(d)** 2 per cent of the aggregate of all amounts each of which is the amount that would, if the definition ***compensation*** in subsection 147.1(1) of the Act were read without reference to subparagraphs (a)(iii) and (iv) and paragraphs (b) and (c) thereof, be the member’s compensation for the year from an employer who participated in the plan in the year for the benefit of the member.

#### Period of Reduced Remuneration


- **(10)** For the purposes of paragraph (9)(d), where a member of a registered pension plan is provided with benefits under a defined benefit provision of the plan in respect of a period in 1990 or 1991
	- **(a)** throughout which, by reason of disability, leave of absence, lay-off or other circumstance, the member rendered no services, or rendered a reduced level of services, to employers who participate in the plan, and
	- **(b)** throughout which the member received no remuneration, or a reduced rate of remuneration,
the member’s compensation shall be determined on the assumption that the member received remuneration for the period equal to the amount of remuneration that it is reasonable to consider the member would have received if the member had rendered services throughout the period on a regular basis (having regard to the services rendered by the member before the period) and the member’s rate of remuneration had been commensurate with the member’s rate of remuneration when the member did render services on a regular basis.

#### Anti-avoidance


- **(11)** Where the terms of a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan can reasonably be considered to have been established or modified so that a pension credit of an individual for a calendar year under the provision would, but for this subsection, be reduced as a consequence of the application of paragraph (3)(g), that paragraph shall not apply in determining the individual’s normalized pension under the provision in respect of the year.

	- **(b)** the total of all amounts each of which is the foreign plan PSPA (determined under subsection 8308.1(5) or (6)) of the individual with respect to the employer associated with a modification of benefits in the year under a foreign plan (as defined in subsection 8308.1(1)), and
	- **(c)** the total of all amounts each of which is the specified retirement arrangement PSPA (determined under subsection 8308.3(4) or (5)) of the individual with respect to the employer associated with a modification of benefits in the year under a specified retirement arrangement (as defined in subsection 8308.3(1)).

#### Accumulated PSPA for Year


- **(2)** For the purposes of this Part, the accumulated PSPA of an individual for a calendar year with respect to an employer, determined as of any time, is the total of all amounts each of which is the individual’s provisional past service pension adjustment (in this Part referred to as “provisional PSPA”) with respect to the employer that is associated with
	- **(a)** a past service event (other than a certifiable past service event with respect to the individual) that occurred in the preceding year; or
	- **(b)** a certifiable past service event with respect to the individual where the Minister has, in the year and before that time, issued a certification for the purposes of subsection 147.1(10) of the Act in respect of the event and the individual.

```
A - B - C + D
```
where
- **A** is the aggregate of all amounts each of which is, in respect of a calendar year after 1989 and before the particular year, the amount that would have been the individual’s pension credit for the year with respect to the employer under a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan (other than a plan that is, at the particular time, a specified multi-employer plan) had the individual’s benefit entitlement under the provision in respect of the year and the employer been equal to the individual’s redetermined benefit entitlement (determined as of the particular time) under the provision in respect of the year and the employer,

- **(4)** For the purposes of the description of A in subsection (3), an individual’s redetermined benefit entitlement under a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan in respect of a calendar year and an employer, determined as of a particular time, is the amount that would be determined under section 8302 to be the individual’s benefit entitlement under the provision in respect of the year and the employer if, for the purpose of computing the benefit accrual of the individual in respect of the year under the provision and, where subsection 8302(6) is applicable, under any other defined benefit provision, the amount determined under paragraph 8302(2)(a) in respect of a specific provision were equal to that portion of the individual’s normalized pension (computed in accordance with subsection (5)) under the specific provision at the particular time, determined with reference to the year, as may reasonably be considered to have accrued in respect of the year.

#### Normalized Pensions


- **(5)** For the purposes of subsection (4), the normalized pension of an individual under a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan at a particular time, determined with reference to a calendar year (in this subsection referred to as the “pension credit year”), is the amount (expressed on an annualized basis) of lifetime retirement benefits, other than excluded benefits, that would be payable to the individual under the provision immediately after the particular time if
	- **(a)** where lifetime retirement benefits have not commenced to be paid under the provision to the individual before the particular time, they commenced to be paid immediately after the particular time,
	- **(b)** where the individual had not attained 65 years of age before the time at which lifetime retirement benefits commenced to be paid (or are assumed by reason of paragraph (a) to have commenced to be paid) to the individual, the individual attained that age at that time,

- **(10)** Subsection (9) does not apply in respect of benefits provided under a defined benefit provision of a pension plan to a member unless the terms of the plan that provide for the redetermination of the amount of the member’s retirement benefits do not apply where retirement benefits have, at any time, been paid under the provision to the member while the member was an employee of a participating employer.

#### Re-employed Member — Anti-avoidance


- **(11)** Where a member of a registered pension plan has become an employee of a participating employer after the member’s retirement benefits under a defined benefit provision of the plan have commenced to be paid and it is reasonable to consider that one of the main reasons for the employment of the member is to enable the member to benefit from terms of the plan that provide for a redetermination of the amount of the member’s retirement benefits provided in respect of a period before the benefits commenced to be paid, the plan becomes a revocable plan at the time the payment of the member’s benefits resumes.

#### Special Rules for Member Aged 70 or 71 in 2007


- **(11.1)** Where
	- **(a)** a member of a registered pension plan attained 69 years of age in 2005 or 2006,

	- **(c)** the member’s retirement benefits are suspended as of any particular time in 2007, and
	- **(d)** the member was employed with a participating employer from the time the member’s retirement benefits commenced to be paid to the particular time,
the following rules apply:
	- **(e)** subsections (9) and (11) shall apply with respect to the member as though the member became an employee of the participating employer at the particular time, and
	- **(f)** for the purpose of subsection (10), retirement benefits paid under the provision to the member before the particular time shall be disregarded.

#### Limits Dependent on Consumer Price Index


- **(12)** Benefits provided under a defined benefit provision of a pension plan that are benefits to which a condition in any of subparagraphs (2)(b)(ii) and (e)(v) and (vi) and (3)(d)(ii) is applicable shall be deemed to comply with the condition where they would so comply if the Consumer Price Index ratio computed as part of the formula that applies for the purpose of the condition were replaced by a substantially similar measure of the change in the Consumer Price Index.

#### Statutory Plans — Special Rules


- **(13)** Notwithstanding subsection (3),
	- **(a)** for the purposes of the condition in paragraph (3)(b) as it applies in respect of benefits provided under the pension plan established by the [Public Service Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-36.md), the reference to “any other registered pension plan” in subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) does not include the pension plans established by the [Canadian Forces Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-17.md) and the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/R/R-11.md); and

- **(14)** Where
	- **(a)** the amount of lifetime retirement benefits provided under a defined benefit provision of a registered pension plan to a member depends on the member’s remuneration,
	- **(b)** remuneration (in this subsection referred to as “excluded remuneration”) of certain types is disregarded for the purpose of determining the amount of the member’s lifetime retirement benefits, and
	- **(c)** it can reasonably be considered that one of the main reasons that remuneration in the form of excluded remuneration was paid to the member by an employer at any time was to artificially reduce a pension credit of the member under the provision with respect to the employer,
the following rules apply for the purposes of the conditions in subsection 8504(1):
	- **(d)** the member shall be deemed to have been connected with the employer while the member was employed by the employer, and
	- **(e)** the member shall be deemed not to have received such remuneration as is excluded remuneration.

#### Past Service Employer Contributions


- **(15)** Where

	- **(b)** the contribution is made
		- **(i)** after December 10, 1989, or
		- **(ii)** before December 11, 1989 where the contribution has not, before that date, been approved by the Minister under paragraph 20(1)(s) of the Act, and
	- **(c)** it is reasonable to consider that all or substantially all of such portion of the contribution as is in respect of past service benefits was paid by the employer, with the consent of the member, in lieu of a payment or other benefit to which the member would otherwise be entitled,
the plan becomes, for the purposes of paragraph 147.1(11)(c) of the Act, a revocable plan on the later of December 11, 1989 and the day immediately before the day on which the contribution is made.

#### Rules of Application


- **(21)** Where additional benefits are provided under a defined benefit provision of a pension plan to a member in respect of a qualifying period of the member under the provision, the following rules apply:
	- **(a)** if the qualifying period ends as a consequence of the member’s death, subsections (2) and (6) apply in respect of benefits provided under the provision on the death of the member as if the member’s retirement benefits had not commenced to be paid before the member’s death; and
	- **(b)** the provisions in paragraph (2)(m), Part LXXXIII and subsection 8517(4) that depend on whether the member’s retirement benefits have commenced to be paid apply to past service events, commutations and transfers occurring in the qualifying period as if the member’s retirement benefits had not commenced to be paid.

#### Anti-avoidance


- **(22)** Subsections (20) and (21) do not apply where it is reasonable to consider that one of the main reasons for the provision of additional benefits to the member is to obtain the benefit of any of those subsections.

- **(23)** Where a member is provided with benefits under two or more associated defined benefit provisions, the determination of whether the conditions in subsections (17) and (19) are satisfied in respect of benefits payable or provided to the member under a particular associated provision shall be made on the basis of the following assumptions:
	- **(a)** benefits payable to the member under each of the other associated provisions were payable under the particular associated provision;
	- **(b)** if, before the member’s specified eligi-bility day (determined without reference to this paragraph) under the particular associated provision, the member had commenced to receive retirement benefits under another associated provision on or after the member’s specified eligibility day under that provision, the member’s specified eligibility day under the particular associated provision were the member’s specified eligibility day under that other associated provision; and

	- **(b)** the provisions are in separate pension plans and
		- **(i)** there is an employer who participates in both plans, or
		- **(ii)** an employer who participates in one of the plans does not deal at arm’s length with an employer who participates in the other plan.

#### Subsection (24) not Applicable


- **(25)** A particular defined benefit provision of a pension plan is not associated with a defined benefit provision of another pension plan if it is unreasonable to expect the benefits under the particular provision to be coordinated with the benefits under the other provision and the Minister has agreed not to treat the particular provision as being associated with the other provision.

			- **(A)** the amount determined by the formula
```
.02 × A × (B / C)
```
where
- **A** is the aggregate of all amounts each of which is the member’s compensation for the specified year from an employer who participated under the provision in the year for the benefit of the member,

			- **(B)** the amount determined by the formula
```
D × E

		- **(ii)** the greatest of all amounts each of which is the ratio of
			- **(A)** the average Consumer Price Index for a calendar year not earlier than the calendar year in which the lifetime retirement benefits commence to be paid and not later than the particular yearto
			- **(B)** the average Consumer Price Index for the calendar year in which the lifetime retirement benefits commence to be paid.

```
where
- **J** is the aggregate of all amounts each of which is such portion of the member’s compensation for the calendar year (in this subsection referred to as the “compensation year”) that includes the month from an employer who participated under the provision for the benefit of the member as may reasonably be considered to have been received in the month or to otherwise relate to the month,
- **K** is the greatest of all amounts each of which is the average wage for a calendar year not before the later of the compensation year and 1986 and not after the year of commencement, and

	- **(b)** determine, for the purpose of computing the amount J in subsection (2), the portion of the member’s compensation from an employer for a calendar year that may reasonably be considered to relate to a month in the year by apportioning the compensation uniformly over the period in the year in respect of which it was paid.

#### Part-time Employees


- **(4)** Where the pensionable service of a member under a defined benefit provision of a pension plan includes a period throughout which the member rendered services on a part-time basis to an employer who participates in the plan, the lifetime retirement benefits provided under the provision to the member shall be deemed to comply with the conditions in subsection (1) where they would so comply or be deemed by subsection (3) to so comply if
	- **(a)** for the purpose of determining the amount J in subsection (2), the member’s compensation from an employer for a calendar year in which the member rendered services on a part-time basis to the employer were the amount that it is reasonable to expect would have been the member’s compensation for the year from the employer if the member had rendered services to the employer on a full-time basis throughout the period or periods in the year throughout which the member rendered services to the employer, and
	- **(b)** in determining the amount G in subparagraph (1)(a)(ii), the duration of each period were multiplied by a fraction (not greater than one) that measures the services rendered by the member throughout the period to employers who participate in the plan as a proportion of the services that would have been rendered by the member throughout the period to such employers had the member rendered services on a full-time basis,
and, for the purposes of this subsection,
	- **(c)** where a member of a pension plan has rendered services throughout a period to 2 or more employers who participate in the plan, the employers shall be deemed to be, throughout the period, the same employer, and

```
where
- **A** is the defined benefit limit for the calendar year in which the benefits commence to be paid,

#### Designated Plans


**8515** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of subsections (5) and (9), and subject to subsection (3), a registered pension plan that contains a defined benefit provision is a designated plan throughout a calendar year if the plan is not maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and

exceeds
	- **(b)** 50 per cent of the aggregate of all amounts each of which is a pension credit (as determined under Part LXXXIII) for the year of an individual under a defined benefit provision of the plan.

#### Designated Plan in Previous Year


- **(2)** For the purposes of subsections (5) and (9), a registered pension plan is a designated plan throughout a particular calendar year after 1990 if the plan was a designated plan at any time in the immediately preceding year, except where the Minister has waived in writing the application of this subsection in respect of the plan.

#### Exceptions


- **(3)** A registered pension plan is not a designated plan in a calendar year pursuant to subsection (1) if
	- **(a)** the plan would not be a designated plan in the year pursuant to that subsection if the reference in paragraph (1)(b) to “50 per cent” were read as a reference to “60 per cent”,
	- **(b)** the plan was established before the year, and
	- **(c)** the amount determined under paragraph (1)(a) in respect of the plan for the immediately preceding year did not exceed the amount determined under paragraph (1)(b),
or if
	- **(d)** there are more than 9 active members of the plan in the year, and
	- **(e)** the Minister has given written notice to the administrator of the plan that the plan is not a designated plan in the year.

#### Specified Individuals


- **(4)** An individual is a specified individual for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) in respect of a pension plan and a particular calendar year if
	- **(a)** the individual was connected at any time in the year with an employer who participates in the plan; or

#### Eligible Contributions


- **(5)** For the purpose of determining whether a contribution that is made by an employer to a registered pension plan at a time when the plan is a designated plan is an eligible contribution under subsection 147.2(2) of the Act, a prescribed condition is that
	- **(a)** the contribution satisfies the condition in subsection (6); or
	- **(b)** the contribution would satisfy the condition in subsection (6) if
		- **(i)** paragraph (6)(b) and subparagraph (7)(e)(i) were applicable only in respect of retirement benefits that became provided under the plan after 1990,
		- **(ii)** paragraph (6)(c) were applicable only in respect of those benefits payable after the death of a member that relate to retirement benefits that became provided under the plan to the member after 1990, and
		- **(iii)** the assumption as to the time retirement benefits (other than retirement benefits that became provided after 1990) will commence to be paid is the same for the purposes of the maximum funding valuation as for the purposes of the actuarial valuation that forms the basis for the recommendation referred to in subsection 147.2(2) of the Act pursuant to which the contribution is made.

#### Funding Restriction


- **(6)** The condition referred to in subsection (5) is that the contribution would be required to be made for the plan to have sufficient assets to pay benefits under the defined benefit provisions of the plan, as registered, with respect to the employees and former employees of the employer if

	- **(a.1)** each defined benefit provision of the plan provided that, with respect to restricted-funding members, retirement benefits are payable monthly in advance;
	- **(b)** each defined benefit provision of the plan provided that, after retirement benefits commence to be paid with respect to a restricted-funding member, the benefits are adjusted annually by a percentage increase for each year that is one percentage point less than the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the year, in lieu of any cost-of-living adjustments actually provided;
	- **(c)** each defined benefit provision of the plan provided the following benefits after the death of a restricted-funding member who dies after retirement benefits under the provision have commenced to be paid to the member, in lieu of the benefits actually provided:
		- **(i)** where the member dies within 5 years after retirement benefits commence to be paid under the provision, the continuation of the retirement benefits for the remainder of the 5 years as if the member were alive, and
		- **(ii)** where an individual who is a spouse or common-law partner of the member when retirement benefits commence to be paid under the provision to the member is alive on the later of the day of death of the member and the day that is 5 years after the day on which the member’s retirement benefits commence to be paid, retirement benefits payable to the individual for the duration of the individual’s life, with the amount of the benefits payable for each month equal to 66 2/3 per cent of the amount of retirement benefits that would have been payable under the provision for the month to the member if the member were alive;
	- **(d)** where more than one employer participates in the plan, assets and actuarial liabilities were apportioned in a reasonable manner among participating employers with respect to their employees and former employees; and
	- **(e)** the rule in paragraph 147.2(2)(d) of the Act that provides for the disregard of a portion of the assets of the plan apportioned to the employer with respect to the employer’s employees and former employees were applicable for the purpose of determining required contributions pursuant to this subsection.

#### Maximum Funding Valuation


- **(7)** For the purposes of subsection (6), a maximum funding valuation is a valuation prepared by an actuary in accordance with the following rules:

		- **(iv)** when the member’s retirement benefits commence to be paid, the member will be married to a person who is the same age as the member;
	- **(f)** the rate of mortality at each age is equal to

### **SCHEDULE V** 
**(Sections 1100, 1101 and 1104)**
## Capital Cost Allowances, Industrial Mineral Mines
**1** For the purposes of paragraph 1100(1)(g), the amount that may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year in respect of a property described in that paragraph that is an industrial mineral mine or a right to remove industrial minerals from an industrial mineral mine is the lesser of
- **(a)** an amount computed on the basis of a rate (computed under section 2 or 3 of this Schedule, as the case may be) per unit of mineral mined in the taxation year; and
- **(b)** the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer as of the end of the taxation year (before making any deduction under section 1100) of the mine or right.


**2** Where the taxpayer has not been granted an allowance in respect of the mine or right for a previous taxation year, the rate for a taxation year is an amount determined by dividing the capital cost of the mine or right to the taxpayer minus the residual value, if any, by
- **(a)** in any case where the taxpayer has acquired a right to remove only a specified number of units, the specified number of units of material that he acquired a right to remove; and
- **(b)** in any other case, the number of units of commercially mineable material estimated as being in the mine when the mine or right was acquired.


**3** Where the taxpayer has been granted an allowance in respect of the mine or right in a previous taxation year, the rate for the taxation year is
- **(a)** where paragraph (b) does not apply, the rate employed to determine the allowance for the most recent year for which an allowance was granted; and
- **(b)** where it has been established that the number of units of material remaining to be mined in the previous taxation year was in fact different from the quantity that was employed in determining the rate for the previous year referred to in paragraph (a), or where it has been established that the capital cost of the mine or right is substantially different from the amount that was employed in determining the rate for that previous year, a rate determined by dividing the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of the mine or right as of the commencement of the year minus the residual value, if any, by
	- **(i)** in any case where the taxpayer has acquired a right to remove only a specified number of units, the number of units of commercially mineable material that, at the commencement of the year, he had a right to remove, and
	- **(ii)** in any other case, the number of units of commercially mineable material estimated as remaining in the mine at the commencement of the year.


**4** In lieu of the aggregate of deductions otherwise allowable under this Schedule, a taxpayer may elect that the deduction for the taxation year be the lesser of
- **(a)** $100; and
- **(b)** the amount received by him in the taxation year from the sale of mineral.


**5** In this Schedule, ***residual value*** means the estimated value of the property if all commercially mineable material were removed.

### **SCHEDULE VI** 
**(Sections 1100 and 1101)**
## Capital Cost Allowances, Timber Limits and Cutting Rights
**1** For the purposes of paragraph 1100(1)(e), the amount that may be deducted in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year in respect of the capital cost to him of a property, other than a timber resource property, that is a timber limit or a right to cut timber from a limit is the lesser of
- **(a)** the aggregate of
	- **(i)** an amount computed on the basis of a rate (determined under section 2 or 3 of this Schedule) per cord, board foot or cubic metre cut in the year, and
	- **(ii)** the lesser of
		- **(A)** 1/10 of the amount expended by the taxpayer after the commencement of his 1949 taxation year that is included in the capital cost to him of the timber limit or right, for surveys, cruises or preparation of prints, maps or plans for the purpose of obtaining a licence or right to cut timber, and
		- **(B)** the amount expended as described in clause (A) minus the aggregate of amounts deducted under this subparagraph in computing the income of the taxpayer in previous years; and
- **(b)** the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer as of the end of the year (before making any deduction under section 1100 for the year) of the timber limit or right.


**2** If the taxpayer has not been granted an allowance in respect of the limit or right for a previous taxation year, the rate for a taxation year is an amount determined by dividing
- **(a)** the capital cost of the limit or right to the taxpayer, minus the aggregate of the residual value of the timber limit and any amount expended by the taxpayer after the commencement of his 1949 taxation year that is included in the capital cost to him of the timber limit or right, for surveys, cruises or preparation of prints, maps or plans for the purpose of obtaining a licence or right to cut timber,
by
- **(b)** the quantity of timber in the limit or the quantity of timber the taxpayer has obtained a right to cut, as the case may be, (expressed in cords, board feet or cubic metres) as shown by a cruise.


**3** If the taxpayer has been granted an allowance in respect of the limit or right in a previous taxation year, the rate for a taxation year is
- **(a)** where paragraph (b) does not apply, the rate employed to determine the allowance for the most recent year for which an allowance was granted; and
- **(b)** where it has been established that the quantity of timber that was in the limit or that the taxpayer had a right to cut was in fact substantially different from the quantity that was employed in determining the rate for the previous year referred to in paragraph (a), or where it has been established that the capital cost of the limit or right is substantially different from the amount that was employed in determining the rate for that previous year, a rate determined by dividing
	- **(i)** the undepreciated capital cost to the taxpayer of the limit or right as of the commencement of the year, minus the residual value,
by
	- **(ii)** the estimated remaining quantity of timber that is in the limit or that the taxpayer has a right to cut, as the case may be, (expressed in cords, board feet or cubic metres) at the commencement of the year.


**4** In lieu of the deduction otherwise determined under this Schedule, a taxpayer may elect that the deduction for a taxation year be the lesser of
- **(a)** $100; and
- **(b)** the amount received by him in the taxation year from the sale of timber.


**5** In this Schedule, ***residual value*** means the estimated value of the property if the merchantable timber were removed.
