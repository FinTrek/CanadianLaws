- **(8)** Where the deceased had a deposit with a bank or other financial institution, or where such institution holds bonds or certificates on behalf of the deceased, the administrator may require the financial institution to transfer the moneys to the Receiver General for credit to the estate and to turn over to him the bonds or certificates so that he may sell them and deposit the proceeds to the credit of the estate or dispose of them in such other manner as may be prescribed.
