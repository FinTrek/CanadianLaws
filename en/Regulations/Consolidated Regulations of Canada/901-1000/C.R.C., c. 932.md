### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(Section 5)**
## Procedure for the Determination of Mesh Opening Sizes
**1** Cut a sample of mesh 1 foot square from the mesh of the product.


**2** Apply a uniformly distributed load of 0.15 N/mm (10 lb. per running foot) to two opposite edges of the sample so as to induce a state of uniaxial tension in the sample.


**3** With the sample loaded in accordance with section 2, attempt to insert the tip of the probe described in Schedule II through openings in the mesh without cutting the fibres of the material using a force not exceeding 22N (4.95 lb.) at 10 randomly located areas in the sample.


**4** Remove the uniformly distributed load and reapply to the other two opposite edges of the sample so as to induce a state of uniaxial tension in the sample normal to that produced pursuant to section 2.


**5** Repeat the procedure described in section 3.





### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(Section 5 and Schedule I)**
## A Probe Designed To Evaluate Mesh Opening Sizes

### **SCHEDULE III** 
**(Section 5)**
## Test for Strength of Mesh and Integrity of Attachment
**1** 

- **(1)** Place the product, assembled in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, on its side so that its side lies in a horizontal plane.

- **(2)** Any blocking or support necessary to maintain the position described in subsection (1) may be used if the blocking does not act directly on the frame of the side under test.


**2** 

- **(1)** Apply a load of 90N (20.23 lb.) acting uniformly over rectangular areas 150 mm x 75 mm (5.9” x 2.9”) and with the 150 mm (5.9”) sides running transversely to the side, in the following manner
	- **(a)** gradually apply load over 1 second;
	- **(b)** allow full load to act for 10 seconds;
	- **(c)** gradually remove load over 1 second; and
	- **(d)** allow 10-second recovery time.

- **(2)** Repeat 10 times the loading procedure described in subsection (1).


**3** The loading procedure described in subsection 2(1) shall be applied to three areas of each side of the product as follows:
- **(a)** at the geometrical centre of the side or, where exterior framing inteferes with the test, as close as possible to the geometric centre;
- **(b)** at the top rail of the side, with the closer 75 mm (2.9”) edge of the load block between 25 mm and 50 mm (1” and 2”) from the centre of the rail at the transverse centre line of the panel; and
- **(c)** at the bottom rail with the closer 75 mm (2.9”) edge of the load block between 25 mm and 50 mm (1” and 2”) from the centre of the rail at the transverse centre line of the panel.





### **SCHEDULE IV** 
**(Subsection 5(9))**
## Small Parts Cylinder

### **SCHEDULE V** 
**(Section 5)**
## Test for Stability of the Product
**1** Assemble the product in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.


**2** Place the product on a sheet of 19 mm (3/4”) plywood of such a size that all support points or legs are at least 50 mm (1.97”) from any edge of the plywood.


**3** Orient the product so that one set of support points or legs in the same plane is parallel to the edge of the plywood.


**4** Place the 23 kg (51.6 lb.) test device described in Schedule VI on the floor of the product with the 300 mm (11.8”) edge parallel to the side of the product and as close as possible to the side of the product that is parallel to the edge of the plywood.


**5** Tilt the plywood about the parallel edge until the plywood forms an angle of 10° with the horizontal.


**6** Repeat the procedures set out in sections 2 to 5 so that the stability of the product is evaluated about each set of support points or legs in the same vertical plane.


**NOTE:** Downslope edges of the support points may be blocked to prevent slippage during the test.
