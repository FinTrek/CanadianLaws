## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Science Education Sets Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** In these Regulations,

***Act*** means the [Hazardous Products Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/H/H-3.md); (*Loi*)

***oral LD<sub>50</sub> value*** means the single dose of a substance that, when administered orally in an animal assay, is expected to cause the death of at least 50% of a defined population of test animals; (*niveau de la DL<sub>50</sub> orale*)

***replacement chemical*** means a chemical product, as defined in the [Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2001/269.md), for restocking a science education set; (*produit chimique de rechange*)

***science education set*** means a collection of products, materials or substances sold as a consumer product to instruct the user about a science and that contains a chemical product as defined in the [Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2001/269.md). (*nécessaire d’expérience scientifique*)

- **(b)** shall appear in both the English and French languages.



**5** Every science education set shall
- **(a)** contain or bear directions for the safe use of the chemicals that it contains; and
- **(b)** bear, on its outer display carton and in any literature that it contains, the following statement:“WARNING. This set contains chemicals that may be harmful if misused.

Not to be used by children except under adult supervision. Not recommended for children under 12 years of age.”





**6** 

- **(1)** A chemical that forms part of a science education set and any replacement chemical must be packaged in a container that displays the following information:
	- **(a)** the common name of the chemical or its name as accepted by the International Union of Chemistry;
	- **(b)** if the oral LD<sub>50</sub> value of the chemical is more than 50 mg/kg but less than 2000 mg/kg of the body weight of the test animal, the hazard symbol set out in column 2 of item 1 of Schedule 2 to the [Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2001/269.md), in accordance with the requirements for hazard symbols set out in paragraph 17(b) and sections 18, 21, 22, 25 and 26 of those Regulations; and
	- **(c)** if the chemical is a chemical product as defined in the [Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2001/269.md), the hazard symbols and the information required to be disclosed on its container in accordance with those Regulations.

- **(2)** In addition to the requirements set out in subsection (1), each chemical that forms part of a science education set and each replacement chemical, if it is a chemical product as defined in the [Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2001/269.md), must be packaged in a container that meets the requirements of those Regulations.
> SOR/78-395, s. 1; SOR/90-431, s. 3; SOR/2001-271, s. 2.




**7** No chemical in a science education set and no replacement chemical shall be packaged in an amount that is more than five times the oral LD<sub>50</sub> value of that chemical calculated for a child of 20 kilograms body weight.



**8** 

- **(1)** No chemical included in the Schedule and no chemical, the oral LD<sub>50</sub> value of which is equal to or lower than 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the test animal, shall be
	- **(a)** included in a science education set;
	- **(b)** packaged as a replacement chemical; or
	- **(c)** subject to subsection (2), required in any experiment described in the instructions included with the set or replacement chemical.

- **(2)** The instructions accompanying a science education set or replacement chemical may require the use of methanol to operate a spirit lamp.



**9** No science education set shall contain or bear any instruction for, description of or words suggesting a test or procedure
- **(a)** to cultivate or demonstrate the presence of a pathogenic micro-organism; or
- **(b)** to cultivate any micro-organism that is in or taken from a product or substance that may contain pathogenic micro-organisms or to demonstrate the presence of any micro-organism in such a product or substance.



**10** Where any representation is made by any means whatever as to the oral LD<sub>50</sub> value of a chemical in a science education set or of a replacement chemical, the manufacturer or importer thereof shall, upon the request of the Minister, supply to the Minister all the information and data upon which the representation is based.
