***Act*** means the [Hazardous Products Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/H/H-3.md); (*Loi*)

***laminated glass*** means two or more sheets of glass bonded to an intervening layer or layers of plastic material; (*verre feuilleté*)

***safety glass standard*** means Standard for Glass: Safety, for Building Construction, 12-GP-1b, August, 1971, a standard of the Canadian Government Specifications Board; (*norme sur le verre de sécurité*)

***tempered glass*** means glass that has been treated chemically or thermally so that, upon fracture, an entire sheet or pane of the glass disintegrates into many small granular pieces; (*verre trempé*)

***wired glass*** means glass in which a wire mesh has been completely embedded. (*verre armé*)




## General


**3** For the purpose of item 17 of Part I of Schedule I to the Act, safety glass is
- **(a)** laminated glass that, when subjected to the test referred to in Column I of each of items 1 to 4 of the table to this section, shows the resistance to boiling water and impact described in Column II of each such item;
- **(b)** tempered glass that, when subjected to the test referred to in Column I of each of items 4 to 6 of the table to this section, shows the resistance to impact described in Column II of each such item; or
- **(c)** wired glass that, when subjected to the test set out in Standard for Glass: Wired, Safety, for Building Construction, 12-GP-11, January, 1973, a standard of the Canadian Government Specifications Board, and referred to in Column I of item 7 of the table to this section, shows the resistance to impact described in Column II of that item.
