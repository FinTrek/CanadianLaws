**PART III** 
## Description of Approach Surfaces

Being a surface abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 06-24 and 16-34, and more particularly described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 06 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to fifty (50) feet measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, two hundred (200) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and ten thousand (10,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being two thousand (2,000) feet from the projected centre line,



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 16 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to forty (40) feet measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, one hundred and fifty (150) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and six thousand (6,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of the strip the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being one thousand one hundred (1,100) feet from the projected centre line,



**(c)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 24 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to fifty (50) feet measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, two hundred (200) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and ten thousand (10,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being two thousand (2,000) feet from the projected centre line,



**(d)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 34 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to forty (40) feet measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, one hundred and sixty-nine (169) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and six thousand and nine hundred (6,900) feet measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal lines being one thousand one hundred and seventy-six (1,176) feet from the projected centre line,



which approach surfaces are shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3800 dated May 4, 1972.





**PART IV** 
## Description of the Horizontal Surface

Being an imaginary flat surface consisting of a common plane established at a constant elevation of one hundred and fifty (150) feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, which surface is shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3800 dated May 4, 1972.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Strip

Each strip is described as follows:

**(a)** the strip associated with runway 06-24 is one thousand (1,000) feet in width, five hundred (500) feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and six thousand six hundred (6,600) feet in length, and



**(b)** the strip associated with runway 16-34 is one thousand (1,000) feet in width, five hundred (500) feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and four thousand four hundred (4,400) feet in length,



which strips are shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3800 dated May 4, 1972.





**PART VI** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Being a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to seven (7) feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip, and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the horizontal surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip, all as shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3800 dated May 4, 1972.
