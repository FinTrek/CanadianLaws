***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)



**3** For the purposes of these Regulations, the airport reference point is deemed to be 2,188 feet above sea level.




## Application


**4** These Regulations apply to all the lands and lands under water, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, the outer limits of which lands are described in Part II of the schedule, other than such lands as from time to time form part of the airport.




## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct on any land or any land under water to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of the highest point any of the surfaces hereinafter set out that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surfaces; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**6** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 5, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.
