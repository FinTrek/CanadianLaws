> SOR/93-401, s. 2.




**3** For the purposes of these Regulations, the airport reference point is deemed to be 1,129 feet above sea level.




## Application


**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), these Regulations apply to all the lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, including public road allowances, the outer limits of which are described in Part II of the schedule.

- **(2)** These Regulations do not apply to such of those lands, the outer limits of which are described in Part II of the schedule, as form part of the airport from time to time.




## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at that point any of the surfaces hereinafter set out that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the horizontal surface;
- **(c)** the outer surface; or
- **(d)** the transitional surfaces.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 4)**

**PART I** 
## Airport Reference Point

## Description of Outer Limits of Lands

Being two lines drawn parallel to and on opposite sides of and perpendicularly distant 7,500 feet from the centre line of Runway 08-26 and productions thereof, which centre line when produced westerly passes through an iron pipe in concrete on the west boundary of Block 1 of Lot A, Group 2, Kamloops Division, Yale District, Plan 3049, distant southerly 1,095.25 feet, more or less, from the most westerly northwest corner of the said Block 1, and which centre line when produced easterly passes through an iron pipe in concrete on the west boundary of Lot 5, Block 7, Kamloops Division, Yale District, Plan 2456, distant southerly 344.60 feet more or less, from the northwest corner of the said Lot 5 and two lines drawn at right angles to the said centre line from points distant 17,500 feet measured easterly and westerly along the said centre line and productions from the strip ends, which outer limits are shown on Department of Transport Plan No. V.226, dated January 15, 1969.



**PART III** 
## Description of Approach Surfaces

**1** The approach surfaces abutting each end of the strip designated as 08-26 consisting of

**(a)** an inclined plane at right angles to each strip end and rising therefrom at a ratio of 1 foot measured vertically to 50 feet measured horizontally to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles through the centre line of each strip, as produced, at a point 10,000 feet from each strip end measured horizontally and 200 feet above the elevation at each strip end measured vertically, the outer limits of the said horizontal line being 2,000 feet from the produced centre line; and



**(b)** an inclined plane from each inclined plane described in paragraph (a), at right angles thereto and rising therefrom at a ratio of 1 foot measured vertically to 40 feet measured horizontally to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles through the centre line of each strip, as produced, at a point 17,500 feet from each strip end measured horizontally and 387.5 feet above the elevation at each strip end measured vertically, the outer limits of which imaginary inclined plane is 2,000 feet throughout from the produced centre line of the strip.




**2** The approach surfaces abutting each end of the strip designated as 04-22 being an inclined plane at right angles to each strip end rising therefrom at a ratio of 1 foot measured vertically to 20 feet measured horizontally to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to each strip, at a point 3,000 feet from each strip end measured horizontally and 150 feet above the elevation at each strip end measured vertically, the outer limits of each imaginary horizontal line being 650 feet from each projected centre line.


**3** Each of the approach surfaces described in sections 1 and 2 is shown on Department of Transport Plan No. V.226, dated January 15, 1969.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Horizontal Surface

**PART V** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

Being a surface abutting the lateral limits of the approach surfaces described in paragraph 1(b) of Part III of this schedule and the outer limits of the horizontal surface, being an imaginary plane located 2,000 feet above sea level or 30 feet above the surface of the ground at any given location, whichever is the higher at that location, which outer surface is shown on Department of Transport Plan No. V.226, dated January 15, 1969.



**PART VI**
