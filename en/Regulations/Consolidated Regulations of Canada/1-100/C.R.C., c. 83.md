***airport*** means the Gander International Airport, in the District of Gander-Twillingate, in the Province of Newfoundland; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a strip, along and at right angles to the projected centre line thereof, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)
> SOR/95-560, s. 3.




**3** For the purposes of these Regulations, the airport reference point is deemed to be 450 feet above sea level.




## Application


**4** These Regulations apply to all lands and lands under water, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, the outer limits of which are described in Part II of the schedule, except land that from time to time forms part of the airport.
> SOR/95-560, s. 5(F).





## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object, or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point any of the following surfaces that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.
> SOR/95-560, s. 5(F).





## Aeronautical Facilities


**6** No owner or lessee of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit any part of that land to be used or developed in a manner that causes interference with any signals or communications to and from
- **(a)** any aircraft; or
- **(b)** any facilities used to provide services relating to aeronautics.
> SOR/81-171, s. 1; SOR/95-560, s. 4.





## Natural Growth


**7** Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 5, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excess growth.
> SOR/95-560, s. 4.

**PART I** 
## Airport Reference Point

Being a point distant five hundred (500) feet measured southeasterly at right angles to the centre line of runway 09-27, from a point distant three thousand five hundred (3,500) feet measured along the centre line of that runway from its intersection with the centre line of runway 04-22.



**PART II**

**(b)** the strip associated with runway 09-27 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to forty (40) feet measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of each strip two hundred (200) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of each strip and ten thousand (10,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of each strip, the outer ends of each imaginary horizontal line being one thousand two hundred and fifty (1,250) feet from each projected centre line,



which surfaces are shown on Department of Transport Plan MT-1593, dated August 25, 1975.





**PART IV** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

Being an imaginary surface consisting of

**(a)** a common plane established at a constant elevation of one hundred and fifty (150) feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, and



**(b)** where the common plane described in paragraph (a) is less than thirty (30) feet above the surface of the ground, an imaginary surface located thirty (30) feet above the surface of the ground,
