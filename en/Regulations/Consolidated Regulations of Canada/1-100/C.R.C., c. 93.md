***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surface, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)



**3** For the purposes of these Regulations, the airport reference point is deemed to be 898 feet above sea level.




## Application

## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point any of the surfaces hereinafter set out that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surfaces; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.
