## Interpretation


**2** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means Fort McMurray Airport, in the vicinity of Fort McMurray, in the Province of Alberta; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of the strip along and at right angles to the projected centre line thereof, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister***[Revoked, SOR/93-401, s. 2]

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particulary described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)
> SOR/93-401, s. 2.




**3** For the purposes of these Regulations, the airport reference point is deemed to be 1,205 feet above sea level.




## Application


**4** These Regulations apply to all the lands and lands under water, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, that consist of
- **(a)** the lands the outer limits of which are described in Part II of the schedule; and
- **(b)** the lands directly beneath the approach surface, other than such lands as from time to time form part of the airport and such lands as form the Clearwater Indian Reserve No. 175.




## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct, on any land or any land under water to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point any of the surfaces hereinafter set out that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 4)**

**PART I** 
## Airport Reference Point

Being a point distant 500 feet measured northerly and perpendicular to the centre line of runway 07-25 from a point distant 4,580.43 feet measured westerly along the centre line from the intersection of the said centre line with the easterly boundary of the Northeast quarter of Section 21, Township 88, Range 8, West of the 4th Meridian, and which said intersection is distant southerly 74.53 feet, more or less, from the northeast corner of said quarter section.

BOUNDED AS FOLLOWS: on the north by the northern boundaries of Section 36, Township 88, Range 9, West of the 4th Meridian, and Sections 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35, Township 88, Range 8, West of the 4th Meridian and their productions across the road allowances; on the East by the eastern boundaries of Sections 14, 23, 26 and 35, Township 88, Range 8, West of the 4th Meridian and their productions across road allowances; on the South by the southern boundaries of Sections 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, Township 88, Range 8, West of the 4th Meridian, and Section 13, Township 88, Range 9, West of the 4th Meridian and their productions across road allowances; on the West by the western boundaries of Sections 13, 24, 25 and 36, Township 88, Range 9, West of the 4th Meridian and their productions across road allowances; which outer limits are shown on Department of Public Works Plan No. E. 1017, dated September 28, 1972.



**PART III** 
## Description of Each Approach Surface

Being a surface abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated as 07-25 and more particularly described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 07 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to fifty (50) feet measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, one thousand (1,000) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and fifty thousand (50,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being eight thousand (8,000) feet from the projected centre line, and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 25 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to fifty (50) feet measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, one thousand (1,000) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and fifty thousand (50,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being eight thousand (8,000) feet from the projected centre line, excepting thereout all that portion of the said surface contained within the vertical projections of the boundaries of the Clearwater Indian Reserve No. 175,



which approach surfaces are shown on Department of Public Works Plan E. 1017, dated September 28, 1972.
