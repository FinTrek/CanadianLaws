### Weights



#### Interpretation


**71** In this Division, ***weight*** means a weight for use in trade.




#### Design, Composition and Construction


**72** Weights shall be composed of any metal or metals not softer than brass, except that weights of less than one gram in the metric system or less than 10 grains in the Canadian system shall be composed of corrosion resistant metal.



**73** Weight reducing holes shall be so made as to prevent the retaining of adjusting lead or foreign matter and the entire surface of weights shall be smooth and reasonably free from grooves or indentations in which foreign matter could accumulate.



**74** If a weight is equipped with a ring, the ring shall not be removable.



**75** Cast iron weights shall be painted with at least one coat of suitable waterproof metal sealer or primer, and may be also painted with a finish coat if the resulting aggregate coat is thin and durable.



**76** When a cast iron weight is painted, it shall be calibrated after it receives the final paint coat.



**77** All adjusting holes intended to hold lead in a weight shall be undercut or so made as to ensure that the lead is securely held in place and in no case shall the lead project beyond the surface of the weight.



**78** At the time of an examination for the purposes of paragraph 8(b) or 26(1)(c) of the Act, not more than two adjusting holes shall be provided in a single weight and at every examination there shall be lead in each adjusting hole sufficient to accept an examination mark.
> SOR/93-234, s. 2(F); SOR/2014-111, s. 32.




**79** A counterpoise weight the principal section of which is too thin to hold an adjusting hole shall have a boss or lug of a size sufficient to hold the adjusting hole.



**80** A weight with a cavity for loose adjusting material that is fitted with a screw top or plug shall be provided with a positive means of locking, other than by friction, the top or plug to the body of the weight.



**81** Weights shall be constructed to represent
- **(a)** multiples or submultiples of the kilogram, gram or milligram having values equal to 1, 2 or 5 × 10<sup>n</sup> units, where “n” represents a whole number, whether positive, negative or equal to zero;
- **(b)** multiples or decimal submultiples of the pound or troy ounce;
- **(c)** multiples or binary submultiples of the pound or ounce; or
- **(d)** multiples or decimal submultiples of the grain.

#### Performance
> [SOR/2005-297, s. 42(F)]



**82** When a weight that has a marked weight set out in column I of an item in a table to sections 84 to 88 is tested for acceptance limits of error in relation to a local standard weight, the weight is considered to be within the acceptance limits of error if its actual weight determined by the test
- **(a)** is not less than its marked weight; and

- **(a)** is not more than its marked weight by an amount in excess of the amount set out in Column III of that item; and
- **(b)** is not less than its marked weight by an amount in excess of the amount set out in Column IV of that item.

#### Use of Weights


**89** A weight shall be used only with a weighing machine with which it is compatible.



**90** When not in use, a weight that, due to its small size, is not individually marked with an examination mark shall be stored in a container that bears the examination mark.
> SOR/93-234, s. 2(F); SOR/2014-111, s. 33.





**DIVISION III** 
### Static Volumetric Measures



#### Interpretation


**91** In this Division, ***measure*** means a static volumetric measure for use in trade.




#### Design, Composition and Construction


**92** Measures shall be free from ridges or indentations likely to entrap dirt or the commodity measured and shall empty completely when inverted.



**93** The internal horizontal dimensions of a measure for liquids shall be such that the removal from it of an amount equal to the limit of error in deficiency will lower the liquid level by not less than 2.4 mm or 3/32 inch or, if the measure is transparent, by not less than 1.2 mm or 3/64 inch.
> SOR/89-570, s. 6(F).




**94** Subject to section 95, a measure that is not transparent shall be so designed that its capacity is established by the brim and when a measure is equipped with a spout, pouring lip or anti-splash protection, not less than one third of the brim of the measure shall be in a plane parallel to the base.



**95** When a measure is equipped with a lid or cover, the capacity of the measure shall be determined by the bottom of the neck unless a permanent defining line or indicator is provided on the neck.



**96** Unless otherwise authorized by the Minister, all measures for solids shall be cylindrical, designed to be struck with a roller and be of a diameter that does not differ from either the depth or double the depth by more than five per cent.



**97** A measure may be composed of any suitable material that
- **(a)** has sufficient strength, rigidity and durability to maintain its form and accuracy and resist indentation, distortion or breakage under ordinary conditions of trade use; and
- **(b)** is impervious to the commodity for which it is intended.



**98** Unless clearly and permanently marked with the words “Calibrated to Contain” (“calibré pour recevoir”), a measure for liquids shall be of such capacity that, when filled to capacity with water, the indicated volume can be poured out of the measure.




#### Performance
> [SOR/2005-297, s. 42(F)]



**99** When a measure that has an indicated volume set out in Column I of an item in a table to sections 101 to 103 is tested for acceptance limits of error in relation to a relevant local standard, the measure is within the acceptance limits of error if its actual volume determined by the test
- **(a)** is not less than its indicated volume; and
- **(b)** does not exceed its indicated volume by an amount in excess of the amount set out in Column II of that item.
> SOR/89-570, s. 6(F); SOR/2012-28, s. 13(F).




**100** When a measure that has an indicated volume set out in Column I of an item in a table to sections 101 to 103 is tested for in-service limits of error in relation to a relevant local standard, the measure is within the in-service limits of error if its actual volume determined by the test
- **(a)** does not exceed its indicated volume by an amount in excess of the amount set out in Column III of that item; and
- **(b)** is not less than its indicated volume by an amount in excess of the amount set out in Column IV of that item.
> SOR/89-570, s. 6(F).

**PART II** 
## Formula for Determining the Weighted Average Quantity of the Units in a Sample

For the purposes of paragraph 52(4)(a), the formula for adjusting the sample mean to determine the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample is as follows:
```
X<sub>a</sub> = x + s(t÷√n)<sup><a href='#fn_Ind1BBE_hq_13381'>[*]</a></sup>
```
where
- X<sub>a</sub>is the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample
- xis the sample mean calculated as follows:
```
x = Σx ÷ n
```

- **Σx** is the sum of the net quantities of all units in the sample
- **t** is the value determined in accordance with Part III for the selected sample size
- **n** is the number of units in the sample
- **s** is the standard deviation of the sample, calculated as follows:
```

> Image: s equals the square root of the quotient of the sum of the squared differences of x minus the mean of x divided by the difference of n minus 1

```

- **Σ(x-** x**)** <sup>2</sup>is the sum of the squared differences between the sample mean and the net quantity of each unit in the sample.

<a name='fn_Ind1BBE_hq_13381'><sup>*</sup></a>: The value of (t ÷ √n) may, instead of being calculated in accordance with this Part, be determined using the applicable value set out in column III of the table to Part III.<br />

- **a** is the value of t for the closest sample size below the selected sample size
