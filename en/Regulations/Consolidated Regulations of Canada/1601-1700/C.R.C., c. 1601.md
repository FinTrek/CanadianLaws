**13** 

- **(1)** The Minister may allow a member, to whom has been made available all or part of his re-establishment credit, to make the compensating adjustment referred to in section 16 of the Act through deductions in such amounts and at such times as will enable such adjustment to be completed contemporaneously with termination of his training under the Veterans Rehabilitation Act, and these deductions may be made from appropriate allowances under the Veterans Rehabilitation Act which might otherwise be available to the member in full.

- **(2)** The method of effecting the compensating adjustment set forth in subsection (1) shall not apply to a member if, in the opinion of the Minister, training would not result in reasonable re-establishment owing to the advanced age of the member or for any other reason, but shall apply to a member who, in the opinion of the Minister, is unable to obtain suitable employment but who possesses a potential physical and mental capacity for work.

- **(3)** The compensating adjustment shall be considered to be either the amount of re-establishment credit made available to the member, or the anticipated costs of training, whichever is the lesser.

- **(4)** Where there is an amount of credit still available to the member which is greater than the anticipated costs of training, no compensating adjustment need be made.

- **(5)** Where due to factors or a combination of factors it would be impossible to make total compensating adjustment by deduction from training allowances within the duration of the course of training, the member shall be required to pay or provide additional compensating adjustment in such amount and manner as the Minister deems just, if the additional adjustment may be reasonably expected to effect total compensating adjustment contemporaneously with the duration of training.
