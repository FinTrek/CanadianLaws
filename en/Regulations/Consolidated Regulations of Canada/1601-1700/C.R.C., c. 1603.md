	- **(a)** an amount based upon the horsepower capacity of the initial development as fixed in the interim licence and computed at the rate fixed in the interim licence for the use of water during the life of the interim licence; or
	- **(b)** an amount based upon the horsepower-year of electrical output and the annual load factor and at a rate not less than the following:
		- **(i)** where the annual load factor is less than 40 per cent, $1.35 per h.p.-year, and
		- **(ii)** where the annual load factor lies between40 per cent and 50 per cent — $1.25 per h.p.-year

50 per cent and 60 per cent — $1.20 per h.p.-year

60 per cent and 70 per cent — $1.15 per h.p.-year

70 per cent and 80 per cent — $1.10 per h.p.-year

80 per cent and 90 per cent — $1.05 per h.p.-year

90 per cent and 100 per cent — $1.00 per h.p-year.



- **(8)** For the purposes of this section,
	- **(a)** the output shall be taken as the total horsepower-years developed during the year on the turbine shaft;
	- **(b)** the annual load factor shall be taken as the ratio of the average load to the maximum load;
	- **(c)** the maximum load shall be taken as the highest rate of output carried by the plant during the year under normal operating conditions for a period of 20 minutes;
	- **(d)** the annual load factor in the case of electrical plants shall be calculated as follows:
```
((Total kilowatt-hours generated per annum × 100)) ÷ ((Maximum load of the year in kilowatts × 8 760)) = per cent load factor;
```

	- **(e)** in the case of plants other than electrical, the annual load factor shall be calculated by substituting horsepower-years and horsepower for kilowatt-hours and kilowatts in the above formula.

- **(9)** For the purposes of these Regulations, one horsepower-year shall be taken as the equivalent of 6 535 kilowatt-hours; and the output at the turbine shaft shall be assumed to be the equivalent of 107 1/2 per cent of the output as recorded at the generator switchboard.

- **(10)** The output and the annual load factor shall be as determined by the Director, who for this purpose may use any available data, such as switchboard records in the case of electrical plants.

- **(11)** Every licensee generating electrical energy, unless exempted by the Director in writing, shall install an approved recording wattmeter and shall preserve and produce for inspection all records made by the wattmeter.

- **(2)** Six months prior to the termination of any 10-year period mentioned in subsection (1), where either the Minister or a licensee deems a revision of the rate of the annual rental per horsepower-year advisable, he may notify the other party to that effect, whereupon both parties shall endeavour to reach an agreement upon the rate for the succeeding 10-year period.

- **(3)** When agreement is not reached within 90 days after the receipt of the notification mentioned in subsection (2), the Minister may refer the matter to such board, commission or authority as may be created or designated by the Governor in Council for the purpose of considering such matter and reviewing the rentals.

- **(4)** The board, commission or authority referred to in subsection (3), when recommending the rentals to be charged, shall take into consideration the earning capacity of the plant, the supply of power available therefrom and from any other sources in the district, the average selling price of the power and any special conditions or circumstances affecting the plant.

- **(5)** The rental for each year of a 10-year period mentioned in subsection (1) shall be based on the actual station output for the year in horsepower-years at the turbine shaft as estimated by the Director and in the case of electrical plants the Director may use switchboard records or any other available data.

- **(6)** Where a licensee is engaged in the sale of power, an upward revision of the rate of the rental per horsepower-year may be made only if the upward revision does not make it impossible for the licensee to earn a fair rate of return on the actual cost of the physical properties used and useful in connection with the undertaking, and provides for the amortization of such costs, including interest, as may be necessary and legitimate for promoting and organizing the enterprise and providing capital otherwise than as included in the actual cost.

- **(2)** The decision of the Director in respect of the quantity of water diverted, used or stored, or capable of being diverted, used or stored, or the amount of power developed or capable of being developed under the authority of any licence, is conclusive and binding upon the licensee.



**46** A licensee, before making any material change in any existing works or in their location, shall submit a complete and satisfactory statement and plans of such proposed change to the Director, and shall not proceed to make the proposed change until it has been authorized.



**47** The Director may require any licensee to install and maintain in good operating condition at such places and in such manner as the Director approves, accurate meters, measuring weirs, gauges or other approved devices which shall be adequate for determining the amount of water used or power developed in the operation of the works, for determining the flow of the stream or streams from which water is or will be diverted, and for determining the amount of water held in or drawn from storage, and the licensee shall keep accurate and satisfactory records of the foregoing determinations and shall from time to time make such returns, supported if necessary by statutory declaration, as the Director may require.



**48** Where, in the opinion of the Minister, a licensee has not developed the amount of power for which there is a public demand and which could be reasonably developed from the flow of water granted under his licence or controlled by him, the Minister may order the licensee to develop and render available for public use the additional amount of power for which there is, in his opinion, a public demand, up to the full extent possible from the amount of water granted under the licence or controlled by the licensee and within a period to be fixed by the Minister, which period shall be not less than two years after the licensee or the person in charge of the existing works is notified of the order.




## Securing Enlarged Development


**49** 

- **(1)** Where, in the opinion of the Minister, it appears feasible to establish an enlarged or more comprehensive development of the water-power in any stream at or near the side occupied by a licensee that will supersede the existing development of the licensee, the Minister may hold a hearing thereon.

- **(2)** The licensee and all other interested parties shall be given not less than 60 days notice of the hearing referred to in subsection (1), and an opportunity of being heard.

- **(3)** Where the Minister considers an enlarged or more comprehensive development of water-power referred to in subsection (1) to be in the public interest, he may offer the licensee a new interim licence for the carrying out of the enlarged or more comprehensive development.

- **(4)** The interim licence offered under subsection (3) shall in every case be subject to the regulations then in force, but in granting the interim licence due consideration shall be given to the existing net earnings of the licensee and to the net earnings likely to be derived from the enlarged or more comprehensive development.

- **(5)** Where, within 12 months after the offer of a licence is made under subsection (3), the licensee fails to accept the offer and in good faith to begin and carry on to completion the enlarged or more comprehensive development, the Minister may, subject to approval by the Governor in Council, order the existing licence terminated.

- **(6)** Where, pursuant to subsection (5), the Minister orders an existing licence terminated, the respective rights of Her Majesty and the licensee in the lands, works and properties connected with the undertaking are the same as those set out in section 28; except that the Minister, in determining the compensation to be paid to the licensee may add such bonus or additional bonus to the amount payable according to section 28, as will in the opinion of the Minister, be proper under the particular circumstances of the case, not to exceed, however, three-quarters of one per cent of the amount payable under section 28 for each full year of the unexpired term of the licence, and not to be less than five per cent of that amount.

- **(7)** Where more than one existing plant or site is affected by the enlarged or more comprehensive development, the Minister may receive proposals from all the licensees or occupants of those sites for carrying out the proposed new development and to offer to each in turn, selecting first that one whose proposal appears to be most in the public interest, or to all conjointly, an interim licence, subject to the regulations then in force, for the carrying out of the proposed new development.

- **(8)** Where a licence is granted pursuant to subsection (7), the existing licences shall be terminated in the same manner and having the same effect, and providing for compensation to the same extent as in the case where the rights of only one existing licensee are affected as set out in subsection (6).

- **(9)** Where, within the time specified, each of the licensees mentioned in subsection (7) in turn fails to accept the offer of a new licence and to begin and to carry on to completion the proposed new works, the Minister, subject to approval by the Governor in Council, may order all the licences terminated in the same manner and having the same effect, and providing for compensation to the same extent as set out in subsection (6).




## Change in Undertaking


**50** Where a licensee desires to develop, sell, use or dispose of any greater quantity of power than is authorized by his licence, whether such increased disposal of power does or does not necessitate any addition to or alteration in the works, or desires to use or dispose of any power in connection with his undertaking in a manner or for a purpose other than as provided in the licence, he shall first apply to the Minister for an interim licence authorizing the construction of the works or for a final licence authorizing the additional development, sale, use or disposal of power or authorizing the use or disposal of the power in such other manner or for such other purpose, as the case may be, and the granting of the licence and the use or disposal of the additional water-power shall in every case be subject to all the provisions of the regulations from time to time in force.




## Sale of Power


**51** In districts where there is no existing authority or competent jurisdiction to regulate and control transmission or distribution companies, no sale or delivery of power shall be made by any licensee to any such company except in case of emergency and then for not more than 60 days without the written consent of the Minister, unless the company has undertaken to the satisfaction of the Minister, to comply with the terms of these Regulations and of the licence to the same extent as the licensee would have been obliged to comply therewith, in so far as the use or disposal of such power is concerned.



**52** Every licensee whose undertaking involves the sale, barter or exchange of the power authorized to be developed under his licence, when so requested by the Minister, shall sell power to the Crown at as low a price as is given to any other consumer for a like use at the same time and under similar conditions, if the request is within the capacity of the site and the rights of any other consumer then holding a binding contract for the delivery of power are not thereby prejudiced.



**53** The Minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, may authorize a licensee whose undertaking embraces the sale of energy or power to enter into contracts for the sale and delivery of that energy or power for periods extending beyond the term of the licence, but for not more than 10 years thereafter, and in such case, the licence will not be terminated at the end of the term unless a new licensee or some competent authority acting for or at the request of the Government of Canada has assumed to fulfil all the contracts so approved.




## Stream Regulation and Control


**54** Every licence is deemed to have been executed on the express condition that the licensee shall, in respect of the river or stream upon which his works are located,
- **(a)** divert, use or store the water authorized to be diverted, used or stored by him in such a manner as not to interfere, in the opinion of the Minister, with the maximum advantageous development of the power and other resources of the river or stream;

- **(3)** Where the capital cost of regulating or storage works upon a stream is assessed pursuant to subsection (2), the assessments shall be determined according to the relative benefits that, in the opinion of the Minister, are or will be derived by the respective owners or licensees of the works from the regulated or increased flow, and may also be charged against owners of water privileges under provincial jurisdiction in accordance with section 56.

- **(4)** The capital cost, assessed pursuant to subsection (2), may be made payable in annual instalments, extending over such period of years, and in such respective amounts for any stated years, as the Minister may determine; and the Minister may provide, if any water-power sites mentioned in subsection (2) are undeveloped or have not commenced to be operated at the time when the regulating or storage works are undertaken, that the commencement of payment of the annual instalments may in such cases be deferred until development and operation take place, or until such time has elapsed thereafter as the Minister may deem suitable.

- **(5)** The total annual outlay in respect of works undertaken under this section shall be a charge upon such of the water-power developments on the stream as are in a position to utilize the regulated or increased flow in whole or in part, and shall be apportioned among them in proportion to the respective benefits estimated as accruing from time to time to those developments from the regulated or increased flow.

- **(6)** A due proportion of the annual outlay in respect of works undertaken under this section may also be charged against owners of water privileges under provincial jurisdiction in accordance with section 56.

- **(10)** A water-power development that has come into operation or the utilization of the stream-flow of which has been substantially increased within the period during which a schedule of the proportion of annual outlay is effective may, at the discretion of the Minister, be debited with its proportionate share of the annual outlay from the time of the commencement of the operation, in which case the proportion charged upon each of the existing developments shall be correspondingly reduced.

- **(11)** In addition to paying the assessments of capital cost and the annual charges as provided for in this section, every licensee may be required to pay for the additional flowage created by any works and used by the licensee such rental as the Minister may determine, subject to these Regulations that are applicable to rentals for the development and use of water power.

- **(3)** In the case of any undertaking established under regulations made under any Act of the Parliament of Canada, the Minister, after conferring with the owner of an undertaking and with the authority, if any, having jurisdiction over the regulation and control of public utilities in the district in which the undertaking is situated, may modify the basis on which the appraisal is to be made.

- **(4)** In any valuation of the lands, works and properties held by a licensee in connection with his licence, no value shall be given or claimed for the rights and privileges granted by his licence over and above the sums, if any, actually paid to the government for such rights and privileges, but not including in any case guarantee deposits paid during the interim licence period nor any rentals or annual charges accruing during the final licence period.
