**PART III** 
## Description of Each Approach Surface

**1** Being a surface abutting each end of each strip associated with runway 11-29, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to fifty (50) feet measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of each strip two hundred (200) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of each strip and ten thousand (10,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of each strip, the outer ends of each imaginary horizontal line being two thousand (2,000) feet from each projected centre line, which surface is shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3710, dated September 20, 1971.


**2** Being a surface abutting each end of each strip associated with runways 02-20 and 06-24, consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to forty (40) feet measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of each strip one hundred fifty (150) feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of each strip and six thousand (6,000) feet measured horizontally from the end of each strip, the outer ends of each imaginary horizontal line being nine hundred (900) feet from each projected centre line, which surface is shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3710, dated September 20, 1971.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Horizontal Surface

Being a surface consisting of a plane located one hundred and fifty (150) feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, which surface is shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3710 dated September 20, 1971.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Strip

The strip associated with runway 11-29 is one thousand (1,000) feet in width, five hundred (500) feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and six thousand four hundred (6,400) feet in length, the strip associated with runway 02-20 is six hundred (600) feet in width, three hundred (300) feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and two thousand eight hundred and seventy-four and seven tenths (2,874.7) feet in length and the strip associated with runway 06-24 is six hundred (600) feet in width, three hundred (300) feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and three thousand one hundred and sixty-five (3,165) feet in length, which strips are shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3710, dated September 20, 1971.



**PART VI** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Being a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of one (1) foot measured vertically to seven (7) feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of each strip, and extending upward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the horizontal surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip, all as shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3710, dated September 20, 1971.
