## Application


**4** These Regulations apply to all lands and lands under water, including public road allowances adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, the outer limits of which are described in Part II of the schedule, except land that from time to time forms part of the airport.




## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct on any land or land under water, to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object, or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point any of the surfaces specified in this section that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,

- **(b)** the outer surfaces; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**6** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 5(a) to (c), the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which the object is growing remove the excessive growth.
