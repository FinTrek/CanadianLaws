- **(a)** calculate the actuarial present value of the pension to which the officer is entitled under Parts I to III of the Act immediately before the election, and the supplementary benefits payable in respect thereof under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md);
- **(b)** convert the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (a) into a joint and survivor pension benefit that consists of
	- **(i)** a pension that is payable, during the life of the officer, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md), as if the pension were a pension payable under Parts I to III of the [Defence Services Pension Continuation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20D-3.md), and
	- **(ii)** a pension that is payable during the life of the surviving spouse, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the officer died and that is equal to 30, 40 or 50 per cent, in accordance with the election made by the officer, of the pension determined in accordance with subparagraph (i), and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md), as if the pension were a pension payable under Parts I to III of the [Defence Services Pension Continuation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20D-3.md); and
- **(c)** subtract the first monthly instalment of the pension referred to in subparagraph (b)(i) from the first monthly instalment of the pension referred to in paragraph (a), and adjust the amount obtained to take into account
	- **(i)** that the reduction is effective during the lesser of
		- **(A)** the period of the life of the officer,
		- **(B)** the period of the life of the spouse, and
		- **(C)** the duration of the marriage,
	- **(ii)** that the reduction becomes effective in the month referred to in section 31, and
	- **(iii)** that the increase in the reduction under section 27 will apply to the reduction in each year referred to in that section.

## Indexation


**27** The amount of the reduction determined in accordance with section 26 is increased on January 1 of each year after the year in which the reduction is first in effect, by the amount that would be payable as a supplementary benefit under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md) if the amount of the reduction determined under section 26 were a pension that became payable under Parts I to III of the [Defence Services Pension Continuation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1970/c.%20D-3.md) on January 1 of the year in which the election was made.

> SOR/94-277, s. 1.




**29** For the purposes of the determinations referred to in sections 26 and 27, the rates of interest set out in the Recommendations for the Computation of Transfer Values from Registered Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, effective September 1, 1993, shall be the rates in respect of fully indexed pensions.

## Cessation of Effect of an Election


**30** An election ceases to have effect on the earliest of

- **(b)** the day on which the annulment of the marriage of the officer and the spouse takes effect, and
- **(c)** the day on which the divorce between the officer and the spouse takes effect.

## Effective Date of Reduction


**31** The amount of the reduction of an officer's pension, calculated in accordance with section 26, shall be subtracted from the monthly instalment of the pension payable to the officer, effective on the first day of the second month after the month in which the election is made. 
> SOR/94-277, s. 1.





## Revocation

## Surviving Spouse Pension


**34** The pension to which a spouse is entitled on the death of the officer who had made an election is equal to an amount determined in accordance with subparagraph 26(b)(i), if paragraph 26(b) were read without reference to supplementary benefits payable under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md).
