**TABLE III** 
## Grades of Honey

**1** ***Canada No. 1*** is the grade name of honey that, in addition to meeting the requirements set out in section 8,

**(a)** contains not more than 17.8 per cent moisture or, where its container is marked “pasteurized” or “pasteurisé”, not more than 18.6 per cent moisture;



**(b)** is free from any foreign material that would be retained on a U.S. National Bureau of Standards standard 80-mesh screen;



**(c)** contains not more than 0.1 per cent water insoluble solids or, where its container is marked “pressed” or “de presse”, not more than 0.5 per cent water insoluble solids;



**(d)** has a flavour characteristic of its colour classification and is free from any objectionable flavour, aroma or taint;



**(e)** where its container is marked “liquid” or “liquide”, is clear, bright, uniform in colour and free from visible crystals; and



**(f)** where its container is marked “creamed” or “en crème” or is otherwise marked to indicate that the contents are granulated, has a smooth fine texture and complete and uniform granulation.




**2** ***Canada No. 2*** is the grade name of honey that, in addition to meeting the requirements set out in section 8,

**(a)** contains not more than 18.6 per cent moisture or, where its container is marked “pasteurized” or “pasteurisé”, not more than 20 per cent moisture;



**(b)** is free from any foreign material that would be retained on a U.S. National Bureau of Standards standard 60-mesh screen;



**(c)** contains not more than 0.1 per cent water insoluble solids or, where its container is marked “pressed” or de “de presse”, not more than 0.5 per cent water insoluble solids;



**(d)** has a flavour that may be slightly off but its honey flavour is not substantially impaired;



**(e)** where its container is marked “liquid” or “liquide”, has a colour that may be dull and cloudy or turbid or slightly uneven and shows not more than slight signs of crystallization in the form of a light suspension or minor sedimentation of crystals; and



**(f)** where its container is marked “creamed” or “en crème” or is otherwise marked to indicate that the contents are granulated, has a texture that may be medium coarse or gritty, but not extremely coarse or gritty, and has a complete and fairly uniform granulation.




**3** ***Canada No. 3*** is the grade name of honey that, in addition to meeting the requirements set out in section 8,

**(a)** contains not more than 20 per cent moisture;



**(b)** contains not more than 0.1 per cent water insoluble solids or, where its container is marked “pressed” or “de presse”, not more than 0.5 per cent water insoluble solids; and



**(c)** has a flavour that may be slightly off but its honey flavour is not substantially impaired.
