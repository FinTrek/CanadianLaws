## Unpaid Instalments


**5** Subject to section 4, where a contributor who has elected to pay in instalments in respect of a period of prior service becomes entitled to any benefit under the Act before the amount payable by him by way of instalments has been paid, the unpaid instalments may be reserved out of the benefit payable to the contributor
- **(a)** in the case of a lump sum benefit, by a lump sum immediately, or
- **(b)** in the case of any benefit other than a lump sum benefit
	- **(i)** by a lump sum immediately, or

		- **(A)** the life of the contributor, or
		- **(B)** the remainder of the period during which instalments under this section are to be paid,
as the contributor elects.



**6** Where any amount payable by a contributor under these Regulations has become due but remains unpaid at the time of his death, the Minister shall, if the amount with interest is not paid forthwith by the personal representative of the contributor, demand payment from the surviving spouse of the contributor to whom a pension is payable under the Act and if the amount with interest to the date of demand is not paid, it may be recovered at any time and, without prejudice to any other recourse available to Her Majesty with respect to the recovery thereof, by retention, by way of deduction or set-off out of the pension payable to the spouse,
- **(a)** in a lump sum immediately, or
- **(b)** in instalments for a term specified by the Minister,
as the recipient elects, with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum.



**7** 

- **(1)** Where an amount that is payable by a contributor is paid after the day on which it is due, there shall, in addition, be payable interest on that amount at the rate of four per cent per annum from the due date until the day on which it is paid.

- **(2)** Notwithstanding subsection (1),
	- **(a)** where a contributor or his personal representative pays in full an amount that is due before the day on which a demand is made under sections 4 to 6 for payment of the amount due, interest is not payable thereon;
	- **(b)** where a demand is made by or on behalf of the Minister under sections 4 to 6 for payment of an amount including interest and that amount is paid in full before the expiration of 30 days from the date of demand, interest is not payable thereon; and
	- **(c)** where a contributor has authorized or directed that the amount payable by him under this section be deducted from moneys payable to him by or on behalf of Her Majesty and the contributor is in default because those deductions have not been made, interest is not payable under sections 4 to 6 on an amount equal to the deductions that have not been so made.



**8** For the purposes of sections 4 to 6, a demand by the Minister for payment of an amount is deemed to have been made on the day on which a letter, demanding payment, signed by or on behalf of the Minister, and addressed to the contributor or recipient, as the case may be, is placed in the mail.



**9** Nothing in these Regulations prohibits a person from paying at any time before it is due any amount payable by him, or that is deductible from his benefit.
