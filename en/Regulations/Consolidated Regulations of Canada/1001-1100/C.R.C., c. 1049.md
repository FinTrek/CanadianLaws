## Methods of Proof and Forbidden Types of Evidence



**DIVISION IV** 
### Character and Similar Facts



#### Evidence of Character and Similar Facts Not Ordinarily Admissible before Finding


**20** Except as prescribed in this Division, the prosecutor shall not introduce evidence of the general bad character or reputation of the accused, or of another act or other acts of the accused similar in essential respects to the act charged.




#### Character Evidence


**21** 

- **(1)** The accused may, by cross-examination or by witnesses, introduce evidence of his good character or reputation and, if he does so, the prosecutor may similarly introduce evidence to rebut it.

- **(2)** A witness testifying as to the character or reputation of the accused may
	- **(a)** report the general reputation of the accused among those who know him or would know about him respecting traits of his character relevant to the charge; and
	- **(b)** state his personal opinion of the general character of the accused in respects relevant to the charge.

- **(3)** When a witness is testifying as to the character or reputation of the accused, he shall not give evidence of particular acts of the accused as the basis of his report or opinion of the reputation or character of the accused, but shall answer questions concerning the duration and nature of his acquaintance or association with the accused, or with others who would be likely to know the accused.

- **(4)** Notwithstanding Divisions V, VI, VII and VIII, hearsay or opinion evidence permitted under this article is admissible.

#### Evidence of Similar Facts


**22** 

- **(1)** If it has been established that the act referred to in the charge was done by someone, but the state of mind or identity of the actor is in doubt, the prosecutor may, subject to subsections (2) and (3), introduce evidence of another act or other acts of the accused similar in essential respects to the act charged, where either or both of the following facts are in issue and the evidence tends to prove one or both of them:
	- **(a)** that the state of mind of the accused was wrongful as charged at the material time, that is, that he did the act charged either knowingly, or with wrongful intent, motive or purpose; or
	- **(b)** that there has been no mistake in the identity of the accused as being the person who did the act charged.

- **(2)** When attempting to prove the charge against the accused, the prosecutor shall establish a real suspicion of the guilt of the accused on issues of state of mind or identity with evidence other than that of essentially similar acts of the accused, before he may introduce evidence of essentially similar acts of the accused.

- **(3)** Although the prosecutor has evidence to offer within subsections (1) and (2), the judge advocate shall exclude that evidence if he decides that its probative value is slight or that it would have an undue tendency to arouse prejudice against the accused, thereby impairing the fairness of the trial.




#### Possession of Property Obtained by Commission of Offence


**23** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), when a person is charged with an offence under section 105 of the [National Defence Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/N/N-5.md) of receiving or retaining in possession property obtained by the commission of a service offence, evidence may be introduced by the prosecutor to show

		- **(i)** involving theft,
		- **(ii)** under section 105 of the [National Defence Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/N/N-5.md), or
		- **(iii)** under section 312 or paragraph 314(1)(b) of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md),
and that evidence may be taken into consideration for the purpose of proving that the accused knew that the property forming the subject matter of the charge was unlawfully obtained.

- **(2)** Subject to section 99, this section shall not apply unless the accused is given at least three days notice in writing of the details of the matters it is intended to prove and, in respect of property other than that forming the subject of the charge, a description of that property and of the person from whom it is alleged to have been stolen.

- **(3)** The words of a declarant under subsection (2) shall not be admissible if the party to whom the statement is adverse shows that the declarant had motive and opportunity before making the hearsay statement to contrive deceitful words to his own advantage, and in the particular circumstances was likely to have done so.

**DIVISION VI** 
### Confessions of Accused Persons



#### Types of Confessions


**36** Confessions are judicial, official or unofficial.




#### Judicial Confession Explained


**37** When, at his trial, the accused chooses to make a complete or partial admission of incriminating facts in respect of an offence for which he is being tried, he may make a judicial confession
- **(a)** by pleading guilty, including pleading guilty subject to variations and exceptions, when this plea is accepted by the court under QR&O 112.25;
- **(b)** after pleading not guilty, and whether or not he also decides to testify as a witness under oath, by personally or through his counsel or defending officer admitting, for the purpose of dispensing with proof, any fact the prosecutor must prove; or
- **(c)** after pleading not guilty, and having elected to testify under oath as a witness in accordance with section 73, by making a self-incriminating statement in the course of his testimony.




#### Effect of Judicial Confession


**38** 

- **(1)** Subject to QR&O 112.26, when a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the court, it is conclusive proof of guilt.

- **(2)** If the accused, after pleading not guilty, admits, other than in the course of his own testimony, a fact alleged against him, the court may accept that admission as conclusive proof of the fact concerned.

- **(3)** If the accused testifies on his own behalf, the court may believe or disbelieve his testimony in whole or in part, including a self-incriminating statement made in the course of that testimony.




#### Official Confession Defined


**39** 

- **(1)** An official confession is a confession made by the accused, whether or not he has been charged, or might expect to be charged, with an offence at the time of making a statement
	- **(a)** when testifying as a legally compellable witness in the course of any judicial or other official proceeding or inquiry, civil or military, other than his own trial for the offence in question; or
	- **(b)** in the course of giving information pursuant to regulations or orders issued by the Chief of the Defence Staff under QR&O 1.23, or in response to an order to him by a superior officer to give information required for any proper military purpose

- **(2)** Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(b), a statement made by the accused in the course of giving information in respect of an accident that has occurred outside Canada involving a motor vehicle under the care, charge or control of the accused is not an official confession for the purpose of these Rules to the extent that the accused, if the accident had occurred in Canada, would have been required by subsection 233(2) of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) to make the statement.




#### Admissibility of Official Confession


**40** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), an official confession by the accused shall not be admissible or used in his trial for an offence in respect of which it is a confession.

- **(2)** When the charge involves perjury, giving false or contradictory evidence, or making a false or contradictory statement, and is based upon a previous statement of the accused purporting at least in part to be an official confession, the prosecutor may introduce this previous statement in evidence.




#### Unofficial Confession Defined


**41** An unofficial confession is a self-incriminating statement made by the accused respecting the offence charged, other than a statement which is a judicial confession under section 37 or an official confession under section 39, and includes a statement made by the accused to civil or military police or other persons in authority as defined in subsection 42(3), whether or not in response to questions by such a person.




#### Admissibility of Unofficial Confession


**42** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (9) and Division IX (Effect of Public Policy and Privilege), a statement by the accused alleged to be an unofficial confession may be introduced in evidence by the prosecutor if he proves that
	- **(a)** there is evidence that the accused did make the statement attributed to him; and
	- **(b)** the statement was voluntary in the sense that it was not made by the accused when or because he was or might have been significantly under the influence of
		- **(i)** fear of prejudice induced by threats exercised, or
		- **(ii)** hope of advantage induced by promises held out, in relation to the offence in question, by a person in authority.

- **(2)** The only inducements by way of threats or promises significant for the purpose of excluding a statement of the accused under subsection (1) are those that a reasonable man would think might have a tendency to cause an innocent accused person to make a false confession.

- **(3)** A person in authority is one who was in a position relative to the accused at the material time to exercise or hold out inducements of the character described in subsections (1) and (2) or was someone who might reasonably have appeared to the accused to be in such a position.

- **(4)** A person may be a person in authority within subsection (3) and possess power by military law to order the accused to answer relevant questions, and yet clearly not exercise nor purport to exercise this power in a particular case, so that a voluntary confession within subsections (1) and (2) might in some circumstances be made by the accused to such a person.

- **(5)** A person who holds a higher service rank than the accused is not, for that reason alone, a person in authority within subsection (3).

- **(6)** Subject to subsection (7), when an unofficial confession is admissible under this section, the whole of it, including any part that is exculpatory, shall be admitted.

- **(7)** When an unofficial confession contains a statement that the accused has committed an offence other than that with which he is charged, the part of the confession relating to that other offence shall not be admitted unless it is relevant to and otherwise admissible in respect of the offence with which he is charged.

- **(8)** The admissibility of an alleged unofficial confession tendered by the prosecutor should be determined at a hearing by the judge advocate in the absence of the court.

- **(9)** The admissibility of a statement made by an accused in the circumstances described in subsection 39(2) to the extent that the statement is not an official confession shall be determined in accordance with the rules of evidence that would have been applied by a court of criminal jurisdiction as defined in the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md) sitting in Ottawa if the statement has been made by the accused in the course of giving his name and address pursuant to subsection 233(2) of the [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md).




#### Statements in Presence of Accused


**43** 

- **(1)** When a statement has been made by another person in the presence of the accused that, if true, would incriminate the accused in whole or in part respecting the offence in question, and the statement was fully understood by the accused, then if it was also clear from the contemporaneous words, conduct or demeanour of the accused that he accepted the statement as true in whole or in part, the statement to the extent that he so accepted it may be treated as an unofficial confession made by the accused.

- **(2)** Whether a statement described in subsection (1) should be deemed to have been fully understood and accepted by the accused as true in whole or in part is, as regards admissibility, a question for the judge advocate under subsection 42(8).




#### Evaluation of Unofficial Confession


**44** 

- **(1)** The decision as to the truth or falsity in whole or in part of an unofficial confession is exclusively a matter for the court.

- **(2)** It is the duty of the court to consider whether an unofficial confession is to be believed or disbelieved in whole or in part in the light of its nature, the circumstances in which it was made, and other relevant and admissible evidence available.

- **(3)** The court may convict on the basis of a complete unofficial confession alone, if it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of its truth.




#### Accomplice’s Evidence


**45** Subject to section 46, where two or more persons are accused of complicity in the same offence, the confession of any one of them is admissible evidence against that one alone, and not against the others.




#### Conspirator’s Evidence


**46** 

- **(1)** When two or more persons are alleged to have been parties to a common criminal plan or design, the words of one of them, apparently spoken or written as part of or in furtherance of the formation or carrying out of that plan, are admissible as evidence against the others as well as against the speaker or writer.

- **(2)** Subsection (1) applies whether the charge alleges the conspiracy itself, or the commission of the offence planned, or the attempt to commit it, and whether an accused is charged singly, or jointly with the alleged co-conspirator whose words purport to incriminate them.

- **(3)** The probative value of evidence admitted under subsection (1) is a matter for the court.




#### Evidence Discovered from Inadmissible Confession


**47** Where an official or unofficial confession is inadmissible under section 40 or 42, but has led to the discovery of other evidence of independent probative value tending to show the accused guilty as charged, that evidence may be given or produced in the usual way by prosecution witnesses, and they may also tell the court that the evidence was discovered because of information given by the accused, but there shall be no other reference to the inadmissible confession.




#### Self-Incrimination


**48** Except as provided in these Rules, an accused person, when giving evidence, has no privilege against self-incrimination by his own statements.




#### Statements not Treated as Confessions


**49** A statement that meets the conditions for admission in section 27, 28, 29, 30 or 60 need not also meet the requirements of this Division, though the statement is classifiable as an unofficial confession.

	- **(a)** the former witness is not available to testify at the new trial because he refuses to be sworn or to give evidence at the new trial, or he is dead, or insane, or absent from the country where the trial is being held, or so ill as to be unable to travel; and

- **(4)** Public documents may be in any form including registers, records, books, maps, recordings, photographs, returns, reports and letters.

- **(5)** It is immaterial for purposes of admission how public documents are filed, collected, bound or stored by the person or persons responsible for their custody, or whether such documents are normally classified for security purposes and it is not a requirement for its admissibility that a public document should form part of a register or record to which members of the general public are entitled to access, it is enough if the document was made for any official purpose.

### Effect of Public Policy and Privilege



#### Secrecy

	- **(a)** instruct the court that, if it concludes that the witness was at any stage an accomplice in the offence charged, there is danger of injustice in convicting the accused of that offence upon the evidence of the apparent accomplice standing alone and uncorroborated, but it is at liberty to do so; or
	- **(b)** advise the court not to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the apparent accomplice, but that it is at liberty to do so if it chooses.

**87** 

- **(1)** Subject to QR&O 112.05, the order of testimony, generally, shall be
	- **(a)** direct examination, that is, the party calling a witness may interrogate him on facts relevant to his case;
	- **(b)** cross-examination, that is, the opposing party then may interrogate the witness on relevant matters, including matters that may tend to discredit the testimony of the witness or support the case of the opposing party; and
	- **(c)** re-examination, that is, the party who called the witness then may interrogate him on matters arising out of the opposing party’s cross-examination.

- **(2)** The president, the judge advocate or, with the permission of the president, any member of the court, may put further questions to a witness either during or at the conclusion of the examination described in subsection (1).

- **(3)** If a witness has been questioned under subsection (2), the prosecutor or accused may, with the permission of the president, put to him such questions relative to the answers as seem proper to the court.




#### Direct Examination — General Rules


**88** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2) as soon as a witness has been duly sworn, the party calling him shall examine him by means of oral questions confined to facts that are relevant to the charge.

- **(2)** Where a witness is called merely for cross-examination by the opposing party, the party calling him need not examine him.




#### Direct Examination — Leading Questions


**89** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and to section 90, the party calling a witness shall not ask him a question that

	- **(c)** to contradict an account that a witness called by the opposite party has given of an extra-judicial utterance.

**90** 

- **(1)** If the prosecutor or accused concludes during the direct examination or re-examination of a witness called by him that the witness is
	- **(a)** directly hostile to him, or
	- **(b)** unwilling to give evidence,
the party calling the witness may apply for a declaration that the witness is hostile.

- **(2)** If the judge advocate declares a witness to be hostile, the party who called him may cross-examine him during the remainder of his testimony, whether on direct examination or re-examination.

- **(3)** A declaration that a witness is hostile shall not affect the rights of the opposite party to cross-examine him.




#### Recorded Past Recollection


**91** 

- **(1)** Where a witness, when the facts are fresh in his mind, has made or verified a written record of them, and is able to swear to the accuracy of that record, it is, subject to subsection (2), admissible as part of his testimony, even though he does not have an independent recollection of the facts disclosed in the record.

- **(2)** Before a record of past recollection can be introduced in evidence, it must be shown to have been made or verified at a time when it was sufficiently fresh and vivid in the mind of the witness to make it trustworthy.

- **(3)** Where the original record has been lost or destroyed, a copy that was verified by comparison with the lost original, or verified apart from the original while the recollection of the witness was still fresh, may be used under subsection (1).




#### Refreshing Memory of Witness


**92**

- **(3)** The cross-examining party may interrogate a witness on
	- **(a)** matters already dealt with in the direct examination;
	- **(b)** other relevant facts that constitute part of the cross-examining party’s own case; and
	- **(c)** subject to subsection (6), matters that, though otherwise irrelevant, tend to impeach the credit of the witness.

- **(4)** The provisions of section 89 do not apply to the cross-examination of a witness.

- **(5)** The cross-examining party shall not put questions to a witness in a bullying way or in any other manner calculated to confuse or mislead the witness unnecessarily, or to insult him.

- **(6)** Where a question is put to a witness as to a matter that is not relevant except in so far as it affects the credibility of the witness, and the witness objects to answering the question, the judge advocate shall consider whether the witness should be compelled to answer it, and if the judge advocate is of the opinion that the imputation conveyed by the question, would, if true,
	- **(a)** seriously affect the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness, he shall require the witness to answer the question; or
	- **(b)** not seriously affect the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness, he shall excuse the witness from answering the question.

	- **(c)** his examination has been stopped by the court before a material question has been put.

- **(2)** A witness called and sworn but not asked any questions by the party calling him, being merely offered for cross-examination, shall not be asked, in cross-examination, questions the sole purpose of which is to discredit him.

#### Examination of Witnesses — Incriminating Questions


**97**

**98** Subject to subsection 94(2) and sections 99, 100 and 101, the prosecutor or accused may, at the proper stage of the trial, by cross-examination or by other witnesses, introduce evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness of the other party.




#### Credibility — Effect of Answers


**99** 

- **(1)** Where a witness has given testimony on matters not material to the charge, he may be cross-examined on that testimony to test his credibility, but subject to subsections (2) and (3), his answers on cross-examination are conclusive in the sense that the cross-examining party may not call witnesses to contradict them.

- **(2)** A witness may be cross-examined on matters not material to the charge to test his credibility by disclosing emotional prejudice and, if the witness denies the facts that show his bias or partiality, the cross-examining party may prove these facts by the testimony of other witnesses.

- **(3)** If a witness who has been convicted of an offence is asked whether he has been convicted of any offence, and he denies the fact or refuses to answer, the cross-examining party may prove the conviction.

	- **(a)** when the statement
		- **(i)** is in writing or reduced to writing, his attention shall be called to the parts of the writing that are to be used to contradict him, or
		- **(ii)** was oral, the circumstances of the statement sufficient to designate the particular occasion shall be mentioned to him; and
	- **(b)** he shall be asked whether or not he did make the statement.

- **(5)** A writing mentioned in subsection (4), shall, if the judge advocate so requires, be produced for his inspection and decision as to whether or not it may be used for the purpose of contradicting the witness and, if allowed for this purpose, may be used only to the extent necessary to prove that the witness made the statement contained in it.

- **(6)** A previous statement proved under this section shall not be considered as evidence of the facts therein but may be considered in so far as it is relevant to the credibility of the witness.




#### Credibility — General Reputation of Witness for Veracity


**101** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a cross-examining party may attack the credit of a witness by introducing evidence of his general reputation for veracity.
