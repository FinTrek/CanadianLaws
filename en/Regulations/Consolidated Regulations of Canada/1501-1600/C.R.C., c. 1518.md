**121** 

- **(1)** Where an application is made for a special renewal permit pursuant to section 116 or 117 for any Canada lands in respect of which no declaration of significant discovery is in force, Petro-Canada Limited shall, on giving notice under subsection (6) that it exercises its rights under this section, have the right to be granted
	- **(a)** where the Canadian participation rate of the applicant for the special renewal permit, determined pursuant to these Regulations is 25 per cent or more but not more than 35 per cent, a 10 per cent interest in the special renewal permit to be granted to the applicant; or
	- **(b)** where the Canadian participation rate of the applicant for the special renewal permit, determined pursuant to these Regulations, is less than 25 per cent, a 10 per cent interest in the permit plus an additional interest therein, not exceeding 15 per cent, of one per cent for every one per cent that the Canadian participation rate falls below 25 per cent.

- **(2)** If, at the time an application is made for a special renewal permit, any well is being drilled on or adjacent to the Canada lands in respect of which the application is made, the application and the determination of the rights of Petro-Canada Limited under this section shall be held in abeyance until the results of the drilling of the well have been assessed by the Minister or a person designated by the Minister.

- **(3)** For the purposes of subsection (1), any existing interest of Petro-Canada Limited, directly or indirectly, in the lands to be included in the special renewal permit referred to therein shall be included when determining the Canadian participation rate pursuant to these Regulations.

- **(4)** On receipt of an application for a special renewal permit for Canada lands in respect of which no declaration of a significant discovery is in force, the Minister or a person designated by the Minister shall, in any case where the Canadian participation rate, determined pursuant to these Regulations, is 35 per cent or less, forthwith give notice in writing of the application to Petro-Canada Limited specifying the area to which the application relates and the identity of the applicant.

- **(5)** The Minister or a person designated by the Minister shall, as soon as possible, give notice in writing to Petro-Canada Limited of the terms and conditions of the special renewal permit that have been agreed on.

- **(6)** Within 60 days from the date of a notice given under subsection (5), Petro-Canada Limited shall give notice in writing to the Minister or a person designated by the Minister stating either that it exercises its rights under this section and, if so, to what extent, or that it chooses not to exercise those rights.

- **(7)** Where Petro-Canada Limited fails to give the notice required under subsection (6) in the time provided therefor or gives notice under that subsection that it chooses not to exercise its rights under this section, those rights are terminated with respect to the lands for which the application for the special renewal permit was made.

- **(8)** Subject to subsection (9), this section applies once only in respect of any lands that are the subject of an application for a special renewal permit.

- **(9)** Where Petro-Canada Limited has no rights under this section with respect to a particular application for a special renewal permit under section 116 or 117 because a declaration of significant discovery is in force at the time the special renewal permit is about to be granted and where that declaration is subsequently revoked with respect to that special renewal permit, Petro-Canada Limited shall, notwithstanding anything in these Regulations, have the rights granted by this section at the first time after such revocation that an application is made for renewal of the special renewal permit if at the time the renewal is about to be granted no other applicable declaration of a significant discovery is in force.
> 1991, c. 10, s. 19.




**122** Where Petro-Canada Limited is granted an interest in a special renewal permit under section 121,

### Canadian Participation Rate


**123** In determining the Canadian participation rate of an applicant for a special renewal permit for the purposes of sections 121 and 122, the following Rules shall apply:**Rule 1** (1) If the applicant is

**(a)** an individual who is a Canadian citizen ordinarily resident in Canada or a landed immigrant within the meaning of the [Immigration and Refugee Protection Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2001/c.%2027.md) who is ordinarily resident in Canada other than a landed immigrant who has been ordinarily resident in Canada for more than one year after the time at which he first became eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship, his Canadian participation rate is 100 per cent;



**(b)** an individual other than an individual referred to in paragraph (a), his Canadian participation rate is 0 per cent;



**(c)** a corporation that has been incorporated in Canada and is not a non-eligible person within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Review Act, its Canadian participation rate is 100 per cent;



**(d)** an enterprise formed by a group of individuals, corporations or individuals and corporations in which each beneficial owner of an interest is an individual referred to in paragraph (a) or a corporation referred to in paragraph (c), its Canadian participation rate is 100 per cent; or



**(e)** a corporation that is a non-eligible person within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Review Act, or is an enterprise formed by a group of individuals, corporations, or individuals and corporations, other than an enterprise referred to in paragraph (d), its Canadian participation rate shall be determined by the application of Rule 2.



**(2)** Where the applicant would be the beneficial owner of the permit, if granted, this Rule shall apply to that applicant, but where the applicant would not be the beneficial owner of the permit, if granted, this Rule shall be applied to the person or enterprise that would be the beneficial owner of the permit as if that person or enterprise were the applicant and where in this manner a Canadian participation rate is determined for a beneficial owner, that Canadian participation rate shall be deemed to be the Canadian participation rate of the applicant for the purposes of section 121.



**Rule 2** Where the application is made by a corporation or enterprise referred to in paragraph (e) of subrule 1(1), the Canadian participation rate in the corporation or enterprise is a percentage equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying, for each beneficial owner of voting shares of the corporation or of an interest in the enterprise, the Canadian participation rate for that owner under Rule 3 or 4 by the percentage of the total number of voting shares of, or total interest in, the corporation or enterprise, beneficially owned by that owner.

**Rule 3** For the purposes of Rule 2, any beneficial owner of voting shares in the applicant corporation, or of an interest in the applicant enterprise, that falls within any of the following classes shall be regarded as having a Canadian participation rate of 100 per cent:

**(a)** an individual referred to in paragraph (a) of subrule 1(1),



**(b)** a corporation referred to in paragraph (c) of subrule 1(1),



**(c)** an enterprise in which the majority interest is beneficially owned by individuals referred to in paragraph (a) or corporations referred to in paragraph (b) of this Rule or any combination of such individuals and corporations,



and the Canadian participation rate for any beneficial owner not falling within any of the above classes is, except where Rule 4 applies, 0 per cent.



**Rule 4** For the purposes of Rule 2, any non-eligible person within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Review Act, or any enterprise other than one referred to in paragraph (c) of Rule 3, that is a beneficial owner of voting shares in the applicant corporation, or any beneficial owner of an interest in the applicant enterprise where that applicant enterprise includes any persons who are non-eligible persons within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Review Act, shall have its Canadian participation rate determined by treating it as if it were the applicant corporation or applicant enterprise under Rule 2 and applying Rule 3 in respect of any of its shareholders or interest owners falling within any of the classes set out in Rule 3, and this Rule in respect of any of its shareholders or interest owners not falling within any of those classes.

**Rule 5** (1) Where, under these Rules, the question arises whether or not a person is a non-eligible person within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Review Act, the Minister or a person designated by the Minister shall apply to the determination of that question the provisions of subsection 4(1) and the other relevant provisions of the Foreign Investment Review Act, subject to such modifications as the circumstances may require, as if the person were an applicant for a statement in writing under that subsection, and as if the Minister or the person designated by the Minister were the Minister referred to in that Act.

**(2)** Any determination made by the Minister or the person designated by the Minister pursuant to subrule (1) is binding only on the person in respect of whom the determination was made, and on the Minister or the person designated by the Minister who made it, and only for the purposes of these Regulations.



**Rule 6** (1) In these Rules,



***enterprise*** means any group or combination of individuals, corporations or individuals and corporations and for greater certainty, but without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, syndicates or other associations; *entreprise*





***voting shares*** means an issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of a corporation to which are attached voting rights ordinarily exercisable at meetings of shareholders. *action comportant droit de vote*



**(2)** For the purposes of these Rules,

**(a)** where any voting share carries the right to more than one vote, the share shall be deemed to be a number of shares equal to the number of votes that it carries;



**(b)** the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate his Canadian participation rate to the satisfaction of the Minister or a person designated by the Minister but where he has not so demonstrated his Canadian participation rate within such reasonable time, but not less than 30 days, as the Minister may allow, the Minister may allocate to the applicant such Canadian participation rate as he deems reasonable in the circumstances, but, in the case of an application made before April 1, 1978, the applicant shall have a period of four months from the day of such allocation to discharge the onus imposed on him by this paragraph and, at the expiration of that period, the allocation is final if the onus has not been discharged, or shall be adjusted to conform to the Canadian participation rate so demonstrated if the onus has been discharged, and such final allocation or adjusted allocation shall constitute the determination of the Canadian participation rate of the applicant for the purposes of section 121;



**(c)** the Canadian participation rate shall be determined as of the day on which any application under section 116 or 117 is made for a special renewal permit and shall be based on information that, in the opinion of the Minister or a person designated by the Minister, is current and accurate information, and such determination is, if all material facts have been disclosed to the Minister or the person designated by the Minister, binding for two years from the day as of which the determination was made, if throughout that period the material facts so disclosed remain substantially unchanged;



**(d)** where it is made to appear to the Minister that any matter required to be determined under these Rules cannot reasonably be determined thereunder in any case or class of cases, he may make the determination, or authorize it to be made, in accordance with such criteria as he considers reasonable in the circumstances; and



**(e)** where, in applying Rule 4, it is found that the applicant corporation or enterprise is one of the beneficial shareholders or interest owners of the corporation or enterprise that is, for the purposes of that Rule, being treated as if it were the applicant corporation or enterprise, the applicant corporation or enterprise shall be deemed not to own the shares or interest in question, and such shares or interest shall be regarded as not forming part of the issued shares of the corporation in question or of the interest in the enterprise in question, as the case may be.






> 2001, c. 27, s. 273.

- **(8)** Any declaration under subsection (1) or (2) is final and conclusive.

- **(9)** Where a hearing is not requested within the 14-day period specified in subsection (6) or is held under this section, any revocation made under this section is final and conclusive.

- **(10)** Where applications affecting the same Canada lands are pending at the same time under subsection (2) and under section 116 or 117, the application under subsection (2) shall be disposed of first and, if any delay arising from the operation of this subsection adversely affects the right of any person to apply or maintain an application for a special renewal permit or a lease under section 54, such right shall be deemed not to be so affected.
