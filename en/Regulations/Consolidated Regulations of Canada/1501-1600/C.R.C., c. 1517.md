<a name='footnote1_e'><sup>1</sup></a>: Revoked by SOR/60-182.<br />




## Notice of Drilling


**4** 

- **(1)** No person shall drill a well or undertake a program of structure test hole drilling unless he has given notice of his intention to begin such operations to the Oil Conservation Engineer and has obtained the approval of the Oil Conservation Engineer.

- **(2)** The notice mentioned in subsection (1) shall be made in triplicate in a form approved by the Department.



**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), no person shall depart from the program of operations that has been approved by the Oil Conservation Engineer without the further approval of the Oil Conservation Engineer.

- **(2)** Where an immediate change in the approved program of operations is necessary, such changes may be made without the approval of the Oil Conservation Engineer, but notice in writing of the change shall be sent to the Oil Conservation Engineer as soon as possible.




## Rotary Drilling Procedure


**6** 

- **(1)** Surface casing satisfactory to the Oil Conservation Engineer shall be used in wells and shall be placed to the depth required by him.

- **(2)** Surface casing shall be cemented by the pump and plug or displacement method from the bottom to top and cement shall be allowed to set for not less than 12 hours under pressure before drilling the plug.

- **(3)** Production casing or intermediate strings of casing when run shall be of a design to meet safety factors of 1.60 in tension, 1.125 in collapse and 1.0 in burst.

- **(4)** The casing design shall be submitted in triplicate to the Oil Conservation Engineer on a form approved by the Chief.

- **(5)** Production casing shall be cemented to a height sufficient to ensure isolation of the productive zones.

- **(6)** The pump and plug method of cementing shall be used and the cement shall be allowed to set for not less than 24 hours and shall be pressure tested in accordance with good oil field practice before the cement plug is drilled.




## Blowout Preventers and Casing Heads


**7** 

- **(1)** In proven areas, the use of blowout preventers is obligatory and they shall be used in accordance with established good practice.

- **(2)** In unproven areas, all drilling wells shall be equipped with minimum blowout-control equipment consisting of
	- **(a)** equipment that will completely close off the open hole;
	- **(b)** equipment that will completely close off around the drill pipe, casing and tubing that are being employed in the drilling operations; and
	- **(c)** a bleed-off line and valve of the proper size and working pressure.

- **(3)** Controls for the blowout preventers shall be located at a point not less than two feet outside the substructure.




## Cable Drilling Procedure


**8** 

- **(1)** Before commencing to drill, proper and adequate slush pits shall be constructed for the reception of mud of sufficient quality and quantity so that such mud may be available if and when the hole is plugged, and where cable tools are used, sufficient surface casing shall be set to a depth specified in the notice of intention to drill and cemented from bottom to top and no natural gas that may be encountered in any section of a cable tool drilled hole above the ultimate objective may be permitted to blow while drilling proceeds, but shall be shut off either by mudding or by the running of a string of casing, and, if the latter method is used, such string of casing shall be tested by bailing to insure shut-off before drilling proceeds.

- **(2)** The casing program adopted for cable tool drilled wells shall be planned to protect any potential oil or gas bearing horizons penetrated during drilling from infiltration of injurious waters from other horizons and to prevent the migration of oil or gas from one horizon to another.




## Coring and Testing


**9** The licensee, permittee or lessee shall, when a well being drilled is approaching a formation from which production of oil or gas may be expected, if required to do so by the Oil Conservation Engineer, core and adequately test such formation, but such coring and testing must be reasonable and proper and not detrimental to the operations being performed and such test shall not be required unless the hole is in proper condition.




## Samples and Cores


**10** 

- **(1)** Unless otherwise directed by the Oil Conservation Engineer, each licensee, permittee or lessee shall cause to be taken, preserved and maintained a series of samples at interval depths of 10 feet of the various formations that non-coring drilling penetrates in drilling a well or structure test hole, and the samples shall be washed, dried, preserved in bags accurately labelled with the name of the well, interval, depth, date of sample and shall be forwarded prepaid in accordance with instructions issued by the Oil Conservation Engineer.

- **(2)** All cores taken from the core barrel shall be stored in book fashion in core boxes and accurately labelled on the body, not the lid, of each box as to the number and interval of the core, top, bottom and footage recovery of the core and the name of the well from which the core is taken.

- **(3)** Boxes shall be of stout wooden or metal construction the sides of which shall project above the level of the contained cores and lids shall be securely fixed to ensure safe transit, and such boxes shall not exceed three feet in length.

- **(4)** Reasonable steps shall be taken to protect boxes containing the cores from theft, misplacement or exposure to the weather and after reasonable time has been afforded the licensee, permittee or lessee to carry out examinations and obtain core analyses of them, they shall be forwarded prepaid to the Oil Conservation Engineer when directed by him to do so.

- **(5)** Without the consent of the Oil Conservation Engineer, no cores shall be destroyed or taken out of Canada except such portions thereof as are reasonably necessary for analytical purposes.




## Deviation Test


**11** The licensee, permittee or lessee, when directed by the Oil Conservation Engineer, shall make or cause to be made tests at intervals not exceeding 500 feet from the top to the bottom of the well or such lesser intervals as the Oil Conservation Engineer may require for the purpose of ascertaining to what extent, if any, the well deviates from the vertical and shall submit a report of the tests with the daily drilling reports at the end of each week.




## Logs


**12** 

- **(1)** Unless otherwise directed by the Oil Conservation Engineer, the permittee or lessee shall cause to be taken one electric log and one other type of electric log, radio-activity log, sonic log or other log approved by the Chief so that the information provided by the two logs shall be sufficient for determining the contacts between horizons or zones penetrated and the porosity and fluid saturation of all potential reservoir horizons.

- **(2)** The title to each log shall contain all information necessary to identify that log and to allow the quantitative and qualitative analysis referred to in subsection (1) to be made.

- **(3)** Three copies of each log shall be sent to the Oil Conservation Engineer within 30 days of the date on which the log was taken.




## Daily Reports


**13**
