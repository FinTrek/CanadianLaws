# Regulations Prescribing Fees for Passport Services

**C.R.C., c. 719**

Enabling authorities: 
- [FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION ACT](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-11.md)

----------



## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Passport Services Fees Regulations.




## Payment of Fees


**2** 

- **(1)** Subject to section 3, every person who requests that a passport service set out in column 1 of the schedule be performed shall pay the fee set out in column 2.

- **(2)** When the Passport Office performs one or more of the passport services set out in any of items 1 to 17 of the schedule, the supply of which requires the opening of a passport issuing office in Canada outside its normal business hours to meet the time requirements of the person for whom the service is performed, that person shall pay, in addition to any applicable fee, the fee set out in item 19 of the schedule.

- **(3)** Despite items 3, 6 and 13 of the Schedule, if a person under one year of age has been issued a travel document valid for a period of three years or less, that person may obtain, before the expiry date of the original document, another travel document without paying a fee if the travel document to be replaced is returned at the same time as the application for the new travel document.

- **(4)** The fees set out in paragraphs 18(a) and (b) and in item 19 of the schedule do not apply in respect of a person who requests any of the passport services referred to in those provisions in order to travel outside Canada in support of any humanitarian operation conducted in response to a natural disaster or human conflict, including rescue, relief and reconstruction operations, if the person provides an official document to the Passport Office from an appropriate authority attesting to the person’s participation in the humanitarian operation.
> SOR/2001-535, s. 1; SOR/2007-68, s. 1(F).




**3** No fee is payable in respect of
- **(a)** a passport service performed for
	- **(i)** a destitute person, or
	- **(ii)** a child or mentally incompetent person living in an institution in another country; or
- **(b)** the issuance of an emergency passport for the return of a Canadian citizen who is deported to Canada.




## Fee Adjustments


**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (5), the fees set out in items 1 to 6 and 8 to 13 of the schedule shall be adjusted, except when the application is made outside Canada and the United States, in respect of each calendar year to take into account any variation in the cost incurred by the Passport Office to send passports and other travel documents by mail or courier.

- **(2)** The amount of the adjustment referred to in subsection (1) in respect of a calendar year is the positive or negative amount, as the case may be, determined by the formula
```
A/B - C
```
where
- **A** is the total cost estimated to be incurred by the Passport Office to send passports and other travel documents by mail or courier in the calendar year;
- **B** is the total number of passports and other travel documents estimated to be sent by mail or courier by the Passport Office in the calendar year; and
- **C** is the cost incurred, per passport and other travel document, by the Passport Office in the preceding calendar year to send passports and other travel documents by mail or courier.

- **(3)** Subject to subsection (5), the fees set out in items 1 to 6 of the schedule shall be adjusted, except when the application is made in Canada or the United States, in respect of each fiscal year to take into account any variation in the amount paid by the Passport Office for the issuance of passports at missions abroad.

- **(4)** The amount of the adjustment referred to in subsection (3) in respect of a fiscal year is the positive or negative amount, as the case may be, determined by the formula
```
A/B - C
```
where
- **A** is the total amount to be paid by the Passport Office to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for the issuance of passports at missions abroad in the fiscal year;
- **B** is the total number of passports that the Passport Office estimates will be issued at missions abroad in the fiscal year; and
- **C** is the amount paid per passport by the Passport Office to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for the issuance of passports at missions abroad in the preceding fiscal year.

- **(5)** There shall be no fee adjustment in a particular calendar year or fiscal year if the variation of the fee in the particular year, combined with any variation of the fee in each calendar or fiscal year following the last calendar or fiscal year in respect of which there has been a fee adjustment, is less than $0.50.

- **(6)** Except when applying subsection (5), if an adjustment results in a fee that includes a fraction of a dollar, the resulting fee shall be rounded upward to the nearest dollar.
> SOR/2001-535, s. 2.





## Remission


**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), a fee paid by a person for a passport service set out in paragraph 18(a) or (b) or item 19 of the schedule shall be remitted by the Passport Office to the person if the reason for travelling is the serious illness of the person or another individual, or the death of the other individual.

- **(2)** The remission referred to in subsection (1) shall be given if the person
	- **(a)** makes a written application to the Passport Office for the remission within 180 days after the passport service is rendered;
	- **(b)** provides a written statement to the Passport Office to the effect that
		- **(i)** the reason for the trip is the person’s own serious illness or the serious illness or death of another individual, and
		- **(ii)** where the reason for the trip is the serious illness or death of another individual, the person has or has had a relationship with that individual; and
	- **(c)** provides an official document to the Passport Office from an appropriate authority attesting to the serious illness or death.
