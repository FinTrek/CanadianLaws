## Foreign Investment Review Act


**4** The Minister shall not authorize a development incentive or loan guarantee to a person who is a noneligible person as defined in the Foreign Investment Review Act, unless that person has complied with the requirements of that Act.




## Product Not Previously Manufactured or Processed in an Operation


**5** No product shall be determined to be a product not previously manufactured or processed in an operation unless, in the opinion of the Minister, on the date of application for a development incentive for the expansion of a facility to enable the manufacturing or processing of the product,
- **(a)** the product is significantly different from any product that on that date is, or within the three years immediately preceding that date was, being manufactured or processed in the operation of which the facility constitutes the necessary components; and
- **(b)** the product cannot be economically manufactured or processed in that operation without the acquisition of additional assets.




## Approved Capital Costs


**6** 

- **(1)** If the amount of a development incentive is based only on approved capital costs, those costs shall include only the approved capital costs of the eligible assets that are installed and utilized in a facility not later than 24 months after the date on which the facility, as established, expanded or modernized, is brought into commercial production.

- **(2)** If the amount of a development incentive is based in part on the number of jobs created directly in the operation of a facility that is established or expanded to enable the manufacturing or processing of a product not previously manufactured or processed in the operation, the approved capital costs of the facility shall include only the approved capital costs of the eligible assets that are installed and utilized therein not later than 36 months after the date on which the facility, as established or expanded, is brought into commercial production.

- **(3)** Subject to subsection (4), the approved capital costs of eligible assets shall be determined by aggregating
	- **(a)** the cost to the applicant of each asset to the extent that the cost does not, in the opinion of the Minister, exceed the fair market value of the asset;
	- **(b)** such capital expenditures as, in the opinion of the Minister, have been or are to be reasonably incurred and paid by the applicant as direct costs of designing, acquiring, constructing, transporting and installing the asset, and of insuring the asset during the construction period; and
	- **(c)** such capital expenditures as, in the opinion of the Minister, have been or are to be reasonably incurred and paid by the applicant or a lessor as
		- **(i)** direct costs of design, acquisition, construction, transportation and installation, and
		- **(ii)** insurance during the construction period,
of machinery and equipment leased by the applicant, where
		- **(iii)** the machinery and equipment is leased for its economic life,
		- **(iv)** the lease includes an option to purchase the machinery and equipment at the fair market value prevailing at the time of exercising the option, and
		- **(v)** in the opinion of the Minister, the inclusion of such leased machinery and equipment as eligible assets for the purpose of a development incentive or a loan guarantee will result in an appropriately lower leasing charge to the applicant.

- **(4)** Where a development incentive has been authorized in respect of a facility, the Minister shall not approve any capital costs of that facility that are in excess of 125 per cent of the capital costs that were accepted by the Minister for the purpose of the authorization unless the applicant, before incurring such excess capital costs, obtained the agreement of the Minister to include such excess capital costs in determining the amount of the approved capital costs.

- **(5)** If, in the opinion of the Minister, the eligible assets installed or to be installed in a facility create a significant change in the plan proposed at the time of authorization of the development incentive, the Minister may reconsider the authorization and amend or withdraw the development incentive previously authorized.




## Jobs Created Directly in an Operation


**7** The number of jobs created directly in the operation on which a development incentive is based shall
- **(a)** include only those involving employment that relates to the manufacturing or processing of products for the production of which the facility is established or expanded; or
- **(b)** in the case of the expansion of a facility, be equal to the number of jobs included in paragraph (a) minus
	- **(i)** the number of persons normally employed in or based upon the facility as it was constituted at the date of the application for the development incentive, or
	- **(ii)** such number of persons as the Minister considers could reasonably have been expected to continue in that facility if the expansion had not taken place,
whichever is the lesser.




## Maximum Number of Jobs


**8** 

- **(1)** Notwithstanding section 7, for the purposes of paragraph 5(4)(a) of the Act, the number of jobs determined by the Minister to have been created directly in an operation shall be the greater quotient obtained by dividing
	- **(a)** the number of man days or fractions thereof, determined by the Minister to have been paid, or deemed by the Minister pursuant to section 10 to have been paid, by the applicant with respect to the employment of persons in or based on the facility during the third year after the date on which the facility is brought into commercial production,
by
	- **(b)** the number of days that the facility is determined by the Minister to have been in operation during the third year referred to in paragraph (a), or
by dividing
	- **(c)** the average of the number of man days or fractions thereof, determined by the Minister to have been paid, or deemed by the Minister pursuant to section 10 to have been paid, by the applicant with respect to the employment of persons in or based on the facility during the second and third years after the date on which the facility is brought into commercial production,
by
	- **(d)** the average of the number of days that the facility is determined by the Minister to have been in operation during the second and third years referred to in paragraph (c).

- **(2)** In determining the number of man days and the number of days that the facility has been in operation for the purposes of subsection (1), the Minister may make the necessary adjustments to take into account such circumstances as he determines to be appropriate.

	- **(a)** the number of jobs created, or
	- **(b)** the wages and salaries determined by him to have been paid by the applicant with respect to the employment of persons in or based on the facility,
averaged over the second and third years after the date on which the facility is brought into commercial production and adjusted to take into account such circumstances as he determines to be appropriate.

- **(2)** In determining the amount of a development incentive, the Minister shall not take into account
	- **(a)** any wages or salaries that, in his opinion, are excessive for the purposes of this section; or
	- **(b)** any amounts that increase the number of jobs or the total wage and salary bill of the applicant to an amount that is in excess of 125 per cent of the amount specified by the Minister for the number of jobs or the wage and salary bill in the authorization of the development incentive unless the creation of such jobs or the expenditure of such amounts was given approval by the Minister prior to the undertaking of the proposed plan or change thereto.
> SOR/78-893, s. 2.

	- **(c)** that is not capable of proceeding because reasonable arrangements cannot be made for adequate financing by means of a loan guarantee under the Act or by other means; or
	- **(d)** that is of such a nature that it merits the offer of a development incentive but for which
		- **(i)** the authorizing of a development incentive that is not repayable would not be in the public interest, or
