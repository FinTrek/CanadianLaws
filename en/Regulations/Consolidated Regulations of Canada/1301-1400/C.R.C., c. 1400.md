**PART V** 
## Release of Seed



### Interpretation


**107** 

- **(1)** In this Part,

***confined release*** means release under conditions intended to minimize the establishment and spread, in the environment, of seed or of genetic material from plants derived from the seed, and the interaction of the seed or genetic material with the environment; (*dissémination en milieu confiné*)

***environment*** means the components of the Earth and includes
- **(a)** air, land and water,
- **(b)** all layers of the atmosphere,
- **(c)** all organic and inorganic matter and living organisms, and
- **(d)** the interacting natural systems that include components referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c); (*environnement*)

***novel trait***, in respect of seed, means a characteristic of the seed that
- **(a)** has been intentionally selected, created or introduced into a distinct, stable population of cultivated seed of the same species through a specific genetic change, and
- **(b)** based on valid scientific rationale, is not substantially equivalent, in terms of its specific use and safety both for the environment and for human health, to any characteristic of a distinct, stable population of cultivated seed of the same species in Canada, having regard to weediness potential, gene flow, plant pest potential, impact on non-target organisms and impact on biodiversity; (*caractère nouveau*)

***release*** means any discharge or emission of seed into the environment or exposure of seed to the environment and includes the growing and field testing of plants; (*dissémination*)

***unconfined release*** means release on an unrestricted basis. (*dissémination en milieu ouvert*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of this Part, seed is toxic if it is entering or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that
	- **(a)** have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity;
	- **(b)** constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends; or
	- **(c)** constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.
> SOR/97-9, s. 1; SOR/2001-274, s. 1.





### Exemptions


**108** The following seed is exempt from the operation of this Part:
- **(a)** seed grown in Canada outside of containment before the coming into force of this Part in such a manner that the seed constitutes a distinct, stable population in the Canadian environment;
- **(b)** seed grown in containment in such a manner that there is no release into the environment of any genetic material from the plants derived from the seed; and
- **(c)** seed that is derived from seed referred to in paragraph (a), or from seed in respect of which an unconfined release has been authorized under paragraph 111(1)(b), and that is substantially equivalent, in terms of its specific use and safety both for the environment and for human health, to seed of the same species, having regard to weediness potential, gene flow, plant pest potential, impact on non-target organisms and impact on biodiversity.
> SOR/97-9, s. 1.
