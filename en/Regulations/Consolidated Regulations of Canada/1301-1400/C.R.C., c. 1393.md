## Calculation of the Reduction


**42** 

- **(1)** The amount of the reduction of the monthly instalment of the immediate annuity or the annual allowance of a contributor who makes an election is equal to the amount determined as follows:
	- **(a)** calculate the actuarial present value of the immediate annuity or the annual allowance to which the contributor is entitled under Part I of the Act immediately before the election, and the supplementary benefits payable in respect thereof under Part III of the Act taking into account
		- **(i)** any amount that is or is to be deducted pursuant to subsection 10(2) of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** the minimum death benefit payable in accordance with section 22 of the Act;
	- **(b)** convert the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (a) into the following annuities, each of which has the same actuarial present value, namely,
		- **(i)** an immediate single life annuity that is payable to the contributor by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were an annuity payable under Part I of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** a joint and survivor pension benefit that consists of
			- **(A)** an immediate annuity that is payable, during the life of the contributor, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act, and
			- **(B)** an annuity that is payable during the life of the surviving spouse, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the contributor died and that is equal to 30, 40 or 50 per cent, in accordance with the election made by the contributor, of the annuity determined in accordance with clause (A), and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were an annuity payable under Part I of the Act; and
	- **(c)** subject to subsection (2), subtract the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in clause (b)(ii)(A) from the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in subparagraph (b)(i), and adjust the amount obtained to take into account
		- **(i)** that the reduction is effective during the lesser of
			- **(A)** the period of the life of the contributor,
			- **(B)** the period of the life of the spouse, and
			- **(C)** the duration of the marriage,
		- **(ii)** that the reduction becomes effective in the month referred to in subsection 47(1) or (2), as the case may be, and
		- **(iii)** that the increase in the reduction under section 43 will apply to the reduction in each year referred to in that section.

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), in determining the reduction for a contributor in respect of whom a minimum death benefit would be payable if the contributor were to die on the day on which the election is made, the actuarial present value that is converted in accordance with subparagraph (1)(b)(i) shall not take into account the amount of the minimum death benefit in respect of that contributor.

- **(2)** Where the election is made in the year in which the contributor retires, the increase in the amount of the reduction pursuant to subsection (1) is determined in respect of the first year during which the increase is in effect from the first day of the month in which the contributor most recently ceased to be employed in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

	- **(d)** the rates of divorce shall be those established by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in accordance with the most recent statistics on divorce published by Statistics Canada.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), the actuarial valuation reports referred to in that subsection are the most recent actuarial valuation reports, or, where the most recent actuarial valuation reports were tabled less than two months before the day on which the contributor made an election, the previously tabled reports.
> SOR/94-347, s. 1.




**45** For the purposes of the determinations referred to in sections 42 and 43, the rates of interest determined in accordance with the section entitled “Pension Commuted Values” of the Standards of Practice — Practice-Specific Standards for Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, as amended from time to time, are the rates for fully indexed pensions.

### Determination of Transfer Value
> [SOR/2012-124, s. 31]



**61** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the transfer value to which a contributor is entitled is a lump sum amount equal to the actuarial present value on valuation day of the accrued pension benefits that would be payable to or in respect of the contributor under the Act.

- **(2)** In the case of a lump sum amount referred to in subsection (1) that is less than the amount of a return of contributions that would be payable on valuation day if the contributor were eligible to receive a return of contributions, the transfer value to which the contributor is entitled is a lump sum amount equal to the amount of that return of contributions.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2; SOR/2012-124, s. 31.




**62** The determination of the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 61(1) is subject to the following rules:
- **(a)** supplementary benefits are to be increased to take into account the period beginning on the later of January 1 of the year in which valuation day occurs and the day on which the contributor ceased to be a member of the Force and ending on valuation day; and
- **(b)** the possibility that the contributor could receive an annual allowance is to be excluded.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.




**63** 

- **(1)** In a determination of the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 61(1), the following actuarial assumptions are to be used:
	- **(a)** the mortality rates for contributors and survivors, including mortality projection factors, shall be those used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(b)** the interest rates are the interest rates for fully indexed pensions — adjusted by the interest rates for unindexed pensions to take into account Part III of the Act — determined in accordance with the section entitled “Pension Commuted Values” of the Standards of Practice — Practice-Specific Standards for Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, as amended from time to time;
	- **(c)** the probability that a contributor will have a survivor shall be based on the rates regarding the average age and eligibility status of survivors at the death of a contributor used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(d)** the probability that a contributor will be survived by children shall be based on the rates regarding the assumed number, average age and eligibility status of children at the death of a contributor used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act; and
	- **(e)** the probability that a contributor will become entitled to a benefit by reason of disability shall be based on the disability incidence rates used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act, taking into account the probability set out in that report, in the case of a compulsory retirement from the Force due to disability, that there would be immediate eligibility for Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits.

- **(2)** The actuarial valuation report referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (c) to (e) is the actuarial valuation report most recently laid before Parliament in accordance with section 30 of the Act before valuation day or, if that report was laid before Parliament in the month in which valuation day occurs or in the preceding month, the report that was laid before Parliament immediately previous to that report.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2; SOR/2012-124, s. 23.




**64** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), a contributor’s pensionable service is that which is to the credit of the contributor on the day on which the contributor ceases to be a member of the Force.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection 12.1(3) of the Act, the pensionable service to the credit of a contributor who has elected to pay for a period of pensionable service by means of instalments shall include only the portion of the pensionable service subject to the election that corresponds to the payments that were made or ought to have been made on or before valuation day.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2; SOR/2012-124, s. 24.

**65** If a division of a contributor’s pension benefits is effected under section 8 of the [Pension Benefits Division Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2046,%20Sch.%20II.md) before valuation day, the lump sum amount referred to in section 61 shall be reduced to take into account the adjustment to the contributor’s pension benefits made in accordance with section 21 of the [Pension Benefits Division Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/94/612.md).
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.

## Transfer Agreements


**70** For the purposes of subsection 24.1(1) of the Act, a pension plan is a pension plan registered under section 147.1 of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md) with at least 10 active participants on the day that the eligible employer enters into an agreement under subsection 24.1(2) of the Act.
> SOR/2012-124, s. 29.




**71** For the purposes of clause 6(a)(ii)(C) of the Act, an employee may count a period of service as pensionable service to the following extent and subject to the following terms and conditions:
- **(a)** any part of a period of service during which the contributor worked part-time is counted in the proportion determined by the formula set out in subsection 11.6(1), and the total period of service is taken into account in determining eligibility for a benefit;
- **(b)** any period of service in respect of which the amount referred to in a demand for funds, made to an eligible employer in respect of an employee in accordance with an agreement referred to in subsection 24.1(2) of the Act, has not been paid in total by an employer, is
	- **(i)** if the period includes only full-time service, counted, beginning with the part that is most recent in point of time, in the same proportion as the amount paid by the employer bears to the amount referred to in the demand for funds, or
	- **(ii)** if the period includes both full-time service and part-time service, converted to full-time service and costed as a period of full-time service, with the counted part being the most recent in point of time; and
- **(c)** if the pension benefits that have accrued in respect of the period of service were subject to a division under a pension plan that was subject to the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md) or an equivalent provincial Act, only the part of the period of service that corresponds to the portion of the benefits that remain accrued to the employee is, after confirmation of the division by the eligible employer, counted and the total period of service is taken into account in determining eligibility for a benefit.
> SOR/2012-124, s. 29.




**72** For the purposes of paragraph 10(4)(b) of the Act, the annual rate of pay that the contributor is deemed to have received during a period of service that is counted as a period of pensionable service under clause 6(a)(ii)(C) of the Act is determined in accordance with section 9.095, except that the valuation day is the one that is set out in the agreement referred to in subsection 24.1(2) of the Act.
