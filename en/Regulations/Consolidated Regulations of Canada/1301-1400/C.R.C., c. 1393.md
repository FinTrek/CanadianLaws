			- **(B)** the period of the life of the spouse, and
			- **(C)** the duration of the marriage,
		- **(ii)** that the reduction becomes effective in the month referred to in subsection 47(1) or (2), as the case may be, and

- **(2)** Where the election is made in the year in which the contributor retires, the increase in the amount of the reduction pursuant to subsection (1) is determined in respect of the first year during which the increase is in effect from the first day of the month in which the contributor most recently ceased to be employed in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

### Determination of Commuted Value


**61** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the commuted value to which a contributor is entitled is a lump sum amount equal to the actuarial present value on valuation day of the accrued pension benefits that would be payable to or in respect of the contributor under the Act.

- **(2)** In the case of a lump sum amount referred to in subsection (1) that is less than the amount of a return of contributions that would be payable on valuation day if the contributor were eligible to receive a return of contributions, the commuted value to which the contributor is entitled is a lump sum amount equal to the amount of that return of contributions.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.




**62** The determination of the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 61(1) is subject to the following rules:
- **(a)** supplementary benefits are to be increased to take into account the period beginning on the later of January 1 of the year in which valuation day occurs and the day on which the contributor ceased to be a member of the Force and ending on valuation day; and
- **(b)** the possibility that the contributor could receive an annual allowance is to be excluded.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.




**63** 

- **(1)** In a determination of the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 61(1), the following actuarial assumptions are to be used:
	- **(a)** the mortality rates for contributors and survivors, including mortality projection factors, shall be those used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(b)** the interest rates shall be the interest rates for fully indexed pensions determined in the manner set out in the Recommendations for the Computation of Transfer Values from Registered Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, effective September 1, 1993, adjusted by the interest rates for non-indexed pensions determined in the manner set out in the Recommendations to take into account the provisions of Part III of the Act;
	- **(c)** the probability that a contributor will have a survivor shall be based on the rates regarding the average age and eligibility status of survivors at the death of a contributor used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(d)** the probability that a contributor will be survived by children shall be based on the rates regarding the assumed number, average age and eligibility status of children at the death of a contributor used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act; and
	- **(e)** the probability that a contributor will become entitled to a benefit by reason of disability shall be based on the disability incidence rates used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act, taking into account the probability set out in that report, in the case of a compulsory retirement from the Force due to disability, that there would be immediate eligibility for Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits.

- **(2)** The actuarial valuation report referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (c) to (e) is the actuarial valuation report most recently laid before Parliament in accordance with section 30 of the Act before valuation day or, if that report was laid before Parliament in the month in which valuation day occurs or in the preceding month, the report that was laid before Parliament immediately previous to that report.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.




**64** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), a contributor’s pensionable service is that which is to the credit of the contributor on the day on which the contributor ceases to be a member of the Force.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection 12.1(2) of the Act, the pensionable service to the credit of a contributor who has elected to pay for a period of pensionable service by means of instalments shall include only the portion of the pensionable service subject to the election that corresponds to the payments that were made or ought to have been made on or before valuation day.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.





### Reduction


**65** If a division of a contributor’s pension benefits is effected under section 8 of the [Pension Benefits Division Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2046,%20Sch.%20II.md) before valuation day, the lump sum amount referred to in section 61 shall be reduced to take into account the adjustment to the contributor’s pension benefits made in accordance with section 21 of the [Pension Benefits Division Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/94/612.md).
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.

> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.





### Prescribed Immediate and Deferred Life Annuity

### Adaptation of Subsection 12.1(1) of the Act


**68** For the purposes of subsection 12.1(1) of the Act, if the commuted value determined in accordance with sections 61 to 65 exceeds the amount that may, in accordance with section 8517 of the [Income Tax Regulations](/en/Regulations/Consolidated%20Regulations%20of%20Canada/901-1000/C.R.C.,%20c.%20945.md), be transferred to a retirement savings plan or fund, or to a financial institution for the purchase of an immediate or deferred life annuity, the excess amount shall be paid to the contributor.
> SOR/2003-232, s. 2.





### Transfer When Contributor Is Deceased


**69** If the commuted value cannot be transferred in accordance with subsection 12.1(1) of the Act because the contributor is deceased, the commuted value shall be paid to the estate of the contributor.
