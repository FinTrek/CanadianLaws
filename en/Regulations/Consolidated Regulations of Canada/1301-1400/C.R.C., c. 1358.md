### Calculation of the Reduction


**68** 

- **(1)** The amount of the reduction of the monthly instalment of the immediate annuity, annual allowance or deferred annuity of a contributor who makes an election is equal to the amount determined as follows:
	- **(a)** calculate the actuarial present value of the immediate annuity, annual allowance or deferred annuity to which the contributor is entitled under Part I of the Act immediately before the election, and the supplementary benefits payable in respect thereof under Part III of the Act taking into account
		- **(i)** any amount that is or is to be deducted pursuant to subsection 11(2) of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** the minimum death benefit payable in accordance with section 27 of the Act;
	- **(b)** convert the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (a) into the following annuities, each of which has the same actuarial present value, namely,
		- **(i)** an immediate single life annuity that is payable to the contributor by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month following the month in which the election is made, or, in the case of a contributor who is entitled to a deferred annuity that is not payable at the time the contributor makes the election, from the first day of the month in which the contributor reaches the age of 60 years, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** a joint and survivor pension benefit that consists of
			- **(A)** an immediate annuity that is payable, during the life of the contributor, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, or, in the case of a contributor who is entitled to a deferred annuity that is not payable at the time the contributor makes the election, beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the contributor reaches the age of 60 years, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act, and
			- **(B)** an annuity that is payable during the life of the surviving spouse, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the contributor died and that is equal to 30, 40 or 50 per cent, in accordance with the election made by the contributor, of the annuity determined in accordance with clause (A), and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act; and
	- **(c)** subject to subsection (2), subtract the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in clause (b)(ii)(A) from the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in subparagraph (b)(i), and adjust the amount obtained to take into account
		- **(i)** that the reduction is effective during the lesser of
			- **(A)** the period of the life of the contributor,
			- **(B)** the period of the life of the spouse, and
			- **(C)** the duration of the marriage,
		- **(ii)** that the reduction becomes effective in the month referred to in subsection 76(1), (2), (4) or (5), as the case may be, and

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), in determining the reduction for a contributor in respect of whom a death benefit pursuant to section 27 of the Act would be payable if the contributor were to die on the day on which the election is made, the actuarial present value that is converted in accordance with subparagraph (1)(b)(i) shall not take into account the amount of the death benefit payable in respect of that contributor.
> SOR/94-194, s. 1; SOR/94-278, s. 1; SOR/97-490, s. 8.





### Indexation


**69** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the amount of the reduction determined in accordance with section 68 is increased on January 1 of each year after the year in which the reduction is first in effect, by the amount that would be payable as a supplementary benefit under Part III of the Act if the amount of the reduction determined under section 68 were an immediate annuity that became payable under Part I of the Act on January 1 of the year in which the election was made.

- **(2)** Where the election is made in the year in which the contributor retires, the increase in the amount of the reduction pursuant to subsection (1) is determined in respect of the first year during which the increase is in effect from the first day of the month in which the contributor most recently ceased to be employed in the Public Service.
> SOR/94-194, s. 1.

- **(a)** subject to paragraph (b), in respect of fully indexed pensions; and
- **(b)** where a contributor is entitled to an annuity or annual allowance pursuant to section 16, 17 or 24.2 of the Act, in respect of unindexed pensions for the period for which no supplementary benefits would be payable under Part III of the Act.

### Determination of Transfer Value


**90** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the transfer value to which a contributor is entitled is a lump sum amount equal to the actuarial present value on valuation day of the accrued pension benefits that would be payable to or in respect of the contributor under the Act had the contributor become entitled to a deferred annuity under section 13 of the Act on ceasing to be employed in the Public Service, together with interest calculated in accordance with section 93.

- **(2)** Where the lump sum amount referred to in subsection (1) is less than the amount of a return of contributions that would be payable on valuation day if the contributor were eligible to receive a return of contributions, the transfer value to which the contributor is entitled is a lump sum amount equal to the amount of that return of contributions, together with interest calculated in accordance with section 93.
> SOR/97-222, s. 1.




**91** The determination of the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 90(1) is subject to the following rules:

- **(b)** the possibility that the contributor could receive an annual allowance is to be excluded.
> SOR/97-222, s. 1.

- **(1)** In determining the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 90(1), the following actuarial assumptions are to be used:
	- **(a)** the mortality rates for former contributors and surviving spouses, including mortality projection factors, shall be those used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(b)** the interest rates shall be the interest rates for fully indexed pensions — adjusted by the interest rates for unindexed pensions to take into account Part III of the Act — determined in accordance with the section “Pension Commuted Values” of the Standards of Practice — Practice-Specific Standards for Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, as amended from time to time;
	- **(c)** the probability that a contributor will be survived by children shall be based on the rates regarding the assumed number, average age and eligibility status of children at the death of a contributor used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(d)** the probability that a contributor will become entitled to a benefit by reason of disability shall be based on the disability incidence rates used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act, taking into account the probability set out in that report that, where termination of employment was on account of disability, there would be immediate eligibility for Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits;
	- **(e)** the rates of marriage on termination of employment and the rates of divorce after termination of employment shall be those established by the Chief Actuary of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in accordance with statistics on marriage and divorce published by Statistics Canada; and
