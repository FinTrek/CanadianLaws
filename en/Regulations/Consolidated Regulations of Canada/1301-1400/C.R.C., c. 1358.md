		- **(i)** the number of days in a relevant standard work week multiplied by 52, and
		- **(ii)** one day;

	- **(a)** in the case of an employee who, during any relevant period, is or was paid at an hourly rate, by dividing the total number of hours in respect of which contributions are or were made to the Superannuation Account by the aggregate of
		- **(i)** the number of hours in a relevant standard work week multiplied by 52, and
		- **(ii)** the number of hours in a relevant standard work week divided by the number of days in a relevant standard work week;
	- **(b)** in the case of an employee who, during any relevant period is or was paid at a daily rate by dividing the total number of days in respect of which contributions are or were made to the Superannuation Account by the aggregate of

		- **(ii)** one day;
	- **(c)** in the case of an employee who, during any relevant period, is or was paid at a weekly rate by dividing the total number of weeks in respect of which contributions are or were made to the Superannuation Account by 52; or

	- **(a)** the product obtained by multiplying the total amount paid to them for such period by 365, by
	- **(b)** the number of days during which they so served.

- **(7)** Service as a Commissioner appointed under Part I of the [Inquiries Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-11.md) is deemed continuous during the period commencing on the date specified in the instrument of their appointment as their commencement date as a Commissioner and ending on the date they cease to act as that Commissioner.

### Calculation of the Reduction


**68** 

- **(1)** The amount of the reduction of the monthly instalment of the immediate annuity, annual allowance or deferred annuity of a contributor who makes an election is equal to the amount determined as follows:
	- **(a)** calculate the actuarial present value of the immediate annuity, annual allowance or deferred annuity to which the contributor is entitled under Part I of the Act immediately before the election, and the supplementary benefits payable in respect thereof under Part III of the Act taking into account
		- **(i)** any amount that is or is to be deducted pursuant to subsection 11(2) of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** the minimum death benefit payable in accordance with section 27 of the Act;
	- **(b)** convert the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (a) into the following annuities, each of which has the same actuarial present value, namely,
		- **(i)** an immediate single life annuity that is payable to the contributor by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month following the month in which the election is made, or, in the case of a contributor who is entitled to a deferred annuity that is not payable at the time the contributor makes the election, from the first day of the month in which the contributor reaches the age of 60 years, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** a joint and survivor pension benefit that consists of
			- **(A)** an immediate annuity that is payable, during the life of the contributor, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, or, in the case of a contributor who is entitled to a deferred annuity that is not payable at the time the contributor makes the election, beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the contributor reaches the age of 60 years, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act, and
			- **(B)** an annuity that is payable during the life of the surviving spouse, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the contributor died and that is equal to 30, 40 or 50 per cent, in accordance with the election made by the contributor, of the annuity determined in accordance with clause (A), and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part III of the Act, as if the annuity were a pension payable under Part I of the Act; and
	- **(c)** subject to subsection (2), subtract the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in clause (b)(ii)(A) from the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in subparagraph (b)(i), and adjust the amount obtained to take into account
		- **(i)** that the reduction is effective during the lesser of
			- **(A)** the period of the life of the contributor,
			- **(B)** the period of the life of the spouse, and
			- **(C)** the duration of the marriage,
		- **(ii)** that the reduction becomes effective in the month referred to in subsection 76(1), (2), (4) or (5), as the case may be, and

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), in determining the reduction for a contributor in respect of whom a death benefit pursuant to section 27 of the Act would be payable if the contributor were to die on the day on which the election is made, the actuarial present value that is converted in accordance with subparagraph (1)(b)(i) shall not take into account the amount of the death benefit payable in respect of that contributor.
> SOR/94-194, s. 1; SOR/94-278, s. 1; SOR/97-490, s. 8.





### Indexation


**69** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the amount of the reduction determined in accordance with section 68 is increased on January 1 of each year after the year in which the reduction is first in effect, by the amount that would be payable as a supplementary benefit under Part III of the Act if the amount of the reduction determined under section 68 were an immediate annuity that became payable under Part I of the Act on January 1 of the year in which the election was made.

- **(2)** Where the election is made in the year in which the contributor retires, the increase in the amount of the reduction pursuant to subsection (1) is determined in respect of the first year during which the increase is in effect from the first day of the month in which the contributor most recently ceased to be employed in the public service.

> SOR/97-222, s. 1; SOR/2016-203, s. 36.




**91** The determination of the actuarial present value of the accrued pension benefits referred to in subsection 90(1) is subject to the following rules:

	- **(a)** the mortality rates for former contributors and survivors, including mortality projection factors, shall be those used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act;
	- **(b)** the interest rates shall be the interest rates for fully indexed pensions — adjusted by the interest rates for unindexed pensions to take into account Part III of the Act — determined in accordance with the section “Pension Commuted Values” of the Standards of Practice — Practice-Specific Standards for Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, as amended from time to time;

	- **(d)** the probability that a contributor will become entitled to a benefit by reason of disability shall be based on the disability incidence rates used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report relating to the pension plan established under the Act, taking into account the probability set out in that report that, where termination of employment was on account of disability, there would be immediate eligibility for Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits; and
	- **(e)** the probability that a contributor will have a survivor shall be based on the rates regarding the average age and eligibility status of survivors on the date of the death of a contributor used in the preparation of the most recent actuarial valuation report.
	- **(f)** [Repealed, SOR/2016-203, s. 37]

- **(2)** The actuarial valuation report referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) and (c) to (e) is the actuarial valuation report most recently laid before Parliament in accordance with section 45 of the Act before valuation day or, if that report was laid before Parliament in the month in which valuation day occurs or in the preceding month, the report that was laid before Parliament immediately before that report.
