## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Liquefied Petroleum Gases Bulk Storage Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** In these Regulations,

***design pressure*** is synonymous with the term ***maximum allowable working pressure*** as used in the A.S.M.E. Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels; (*pression nominale*)

***filling density*** means the percentage figure obtained when the maximum weight of liquefied petroleum gas that may be in the container is divided by the water weight capacity of the tank and the result is multiplied by 100; all capacities shall be measured at a liquid temperature of 60°F; (*densité de remplissage*)

***liquefied petroleum gases*** are gases derived from petroleum or natural gas; they are in the gaseous state at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, but may be maintained in a liquid state by the application of moderate pressure; the following gases are those most commonly handled as liquefied petroleum gases: propane, normal butane, propylene, isobutane, butylenes; (*gaz de pétrole liquéfiés*)

***main track*** means a track extending through yards and between stations upon which trains are operated by timetable or train order, or both, or the use of which is governed by block signals or other method of control; (*voie principale*)

***owning or operating company*** means the person or company owning or operating the installation, erected with leave of the Commission granted upon application made therefor by the railway company concerned, on behalf of such person or company; (*compagnie propriétaire or exploitante*)

***private track*** means a track outside of carrier’s right-of-way, yard and terminals, and of which the carrier does not own either the rails, ties, roadbed or right-of-way; or a track or portion of a track which is devoted to the purpose of its user, either by lease or written agreement, in which case the lease or written agreement is considered as equivalent to ownership; (*voie particulière*)

***shall*** is used to indicate mandatory provisions; (*le futur*)

***should*** is used to indicate recommendatory [provisions]; (*le conditionnel*)

***Switch heater facility*** means an installation comprising a liquefied petroleum gas heating appliance and attendant fuel storage and distribution systems, the purpose of which is to prevent the failure of a railway track switch due to snow or ice.

***team track*** means a track on railway property which is used for loading and unloading purposes by more than one company or person. (*voie de desserte industrielle*)
