- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***boil-over*** is a term used to describe the action that occurs when a hot layer of crude petroleum or similar liquid comes into contact with an underlying layer of a more volatile liquid and causes that liquid to flash into vapour; the expansion produced by the conversion of the entrapped liquid vapour results in a violent surface action; (*débordement*)

***crude petroleum*** is a flammable liquid with a flash point below 150°F and consisting of an unrefined mixture of natural liquid hydrocarbons as obtained from the earth; (*pétrole brut*)

***flammable liquid*** means any liquid with a flash point below 175°F, as determined by Tagliabue’s Open Cup Tester, and having a Reid vapour pressure not exceeding 40 psi absolute at 100°F or any liquid with a flash point of 175°F or above when it is heated by artificial means to a temperature not less than its flash point temperature; (*liquide inflammable*)

***flame arrestor*** is a device consisting of a group of parallel metal plates, tubes, fins or screens or a similar device with a large surface area for heat dissipation, which is designed to prevent the entrance of flame into a storage tank through a vent or similar opening; (*pare-flammes*)

***flash point*** is the minimum temperature of a flammable liquid in degrees Fahrenheit, as determined by Tagliabue’s Open Cup Tester in accordance with A.S.T.M. Test Method: D-1310-56T at which its vapours will form a flammable mixture with air; (*point éclair*)

***installation*** means an installation of stationary bulk storage facilities for flammable liquids located on the railway right-of-way; (*installation*)

***main track*** is a track extending through yards and between stations where trains are operated by timetable, train order, block signals, or some other approved method of control; (*voie principale*)

***owning or operating company*** means the person or company owning or operating the installation; (*compagnie propriétaire or exploitante*)

***private track*** is a track outside of the carrier’s right-of-way, yard and terminals reserved exclusively for only one owner or lessee; (*voie particulière*)

***shall*** is used to indicate mandatory provisions; (*le futur*)

***should*** is used to indicate recommendatory; (*le conditionnel*)

***station*** means any location where passenger trains may stop in accordance with the current railway timetable; (*gare*)

***team track*** or ***business track*** is a track on railway right-of-way used by more than one company or person; (*voie de desserte industrielle or voie commerciale*)

***vapour pressure*** is the Reid<sup><a href='#fndef_e'>[*]</a></sup> pressure, measured in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) that is exerted by a volatile liquid at a given temperature. (*tension de vapeur*)

- **(2)** For the purpose of these Regulations, flammable liquids are divided into three classes:
	- **(a)** Class I flammable liquids includes all flammable liquids, except crude petroleum, having flash points at or below 80°F; this Class also includes Class II flammable liquids when they are heated by artificial means to temperatures not less than their flash point temperatures;
	- **(b)** Class II flammable liquids includes all flammable liquids, except crude petroleum, having flash points above 80°F but below 175°F; this Class also includes liquids with flash points of 175°F or above when they are heated by artificial means to temperatures not less than their flash point temperatures;
	- **(c)** Class III flammable liquids includes crude petroleum and any other flammable liquid with similar boil-over characteristics having a flash point below 150°F; and
	- **(d)** flammable liquids with a Reid vapour pressure of 40 psi or greater at 100°F are classed as compressed gases.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to the stationary bulk storage facilities for flammable liquids located on the right-of-way owned or leased by any railway company subject to the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transport Commission; facilities previously approved by an order of the Commission shall be operated and maintained in accordance with these Regulations and, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, need not conform to those parts of these Regulations pertaining to location, construction and design.

### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(s. 45)**
## Temporary Transfer Facilities
**1** The transfer of a Class I flammable liquid between a tank car located on the right-of-way of a railway subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and any vessel other than a permanently installed storage tank of sufficient capacity to receive the entire contents of the tank car is prohibited by sections 73.432 and 74.560 of the Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Commodities by Rail and section 45 of these Regulations. However, it is recognized that under certain circumstances temporary relief from compliance with these requirements is in the public interest and may be granted without jeopardizing the safety standards.


**2** The prerequisites for obtaining permission to transfer a Class I flammable liquid between a tank car and a vessel other than a permanently installed storage tank are as follows:
- **(a)** except as provided in paragraphs (b) to (d), the direct transfer of a Class I flammable liquid between a tank car and a vessel other than a permanently installed storage tank shall comply in all respects with the requirements of these Regulations;
- **(b)** the requirements of Part III of these Regulations pertaining to storage tanks are waived;
- **(c)** notwithstanding the distance requirements of Part II of these Regulations, the distance between the transfer connection of a tank car and a building or place shall not  be less than the following:
	- **(i)** a building or a place of public assembly or a residence, 300 feet, and
	- **(ii)** a storage warehouse, a grain elevator, or any building other than those mentioned in subparagraph (i), 150 feet;
- **(d)** notwithstanding the application requirements of Part I of these Regulations, drawings need not accompany applications requesting approval for periods which do not exceed six months if, in addition to providing the information requested in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Schedule, the following information is also provided:
	- **(i)** the location of the proposed transfer operation with respect to railway, town, mileage and subdivision,
	- **(ii)** evidence that the fire prevention authority with jurisdiction in the surrounding area has no objection to the proposal, and
	- **(iii)** the application shall bear a signed and dated statement reading as follows:“This proposal complies in all respects with the conditions of approval prescribed in Schedule II of the Flammable Liquids Bulk Storage Regulations”;


- **(e)** the applicant shall satisfy the Commission that it is not practical or reasonable to erect permanent transfer facilities and storage tanks under the prevailing circumstances, and that granting relief from compliance with the requirements of the Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Commodities by Rail will not create a condition of unfair competition during the period of approval with respect to the permanent storage facilities approved by the Commission and located in the same general area; and
- **(f)** cargo tanks, drums or other vessels, which are used in the direct transfer of a Class I flammable liquid to or from a tank car, shall meet all provincial and local requirements with respect to their registration, design, construction, operation, etc.
