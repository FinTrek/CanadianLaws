***anhydrous ammonia*** is dry ammonia gas in liquified form and is not to be confused with aqua ammonia which is a solution of ammonia gas in water; (*ammoniac anhydre*)

***design pressure*** is synonymous with ***maximum allowable working pressure*** as used in the A.S.M.E. Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code; (*pression nominale*)

***filling density*** is the percentage figure obtained when the maximum weight of anhydrous ammonia that may be in a container is divided by the water weight capacity of the tank and the result is multiplied by 100; all capacities shall be measured at a liquid temperature of 60°F; (*densité de remplissage*)

***main track*** means a track extending through yards and between stations upon which trains are operated by timetable or train order, or both, or the use of which is governed by block signals or other method of control; (*voie principale*)

***owning or operating company*** means the person or company owning or operating the installation erected with leave of the Commission granted upon application made therefor by the railway company concerned on behalf of such person or company; (*compagnie propriétaire ou exploitante*)

***private track*** means a track outside of a carrier’s right-of-way, yard and terminals, and of which the carrier does not own either the rails, ties, roadbed or right-of-way, or a track or portion of a track which is devoted to the purpose of its user, either by lease or written agreement, in which case the lease or written agreement will be considered as equivalent to ownership; (*voie particulière*)

***shall*** is used to indicate mandatory provisions; (*le futur*)

***should*** is used to indicate recommendatory; (*le conditionnel*)

***team track*** means a track on railway property which is used for loading or unloading purposes by more than one company or person. (*voie de desserte industrielle*)

- **(1)** All electrical equipment, fixtures, switches, and wiring inside buildings where anhydrous ammonia is stored or handled shall conform to the requirements of the latest edition of the Canadian Electrical Code for Class I, Division II hazardous locations and any local or provincial requirements of a higher standard.

- **(2)** Electrical installations in other locations within 25 feet of any anhydrous ammonia storage tank, equipment, or loading or unloading point shall conform to the requirements of the latest edition of the Canadian Electrical Code for corrosive atmospheres (Category 2).



**67** 

- **(1)** All uninsulated storage containers with a water capacity exceeding 100 Imperial gallons which are installed out-of-doors shall be painted with a white heat reflective coating, preferably an enamel or self-cleaning paint.

- **(2)** The words “CAUTION — AMMONIA” in letters not less than six inches high shall be painted on each outdoor tank with a water capacity exceeding 2,000 Imperial gallons.



**68** 

- **(1)** Except for the frame, pumphouses, compressor houses, or buildings in which anhydrous ammonia is handled shall be constructed of noncombustible or fire-resistant materials.

- **(4)** Buildings shall be maintained in a clean and tidy condition.



**69** Smoking and the use of portable open flame lights or equipment shall be prohibited except in certain isolated and clearly-designated areas. Signs to this effect shall be posted at the plant entrances and at the loading and unloading sites. (See section 72 for restrictions applying to welding.)



**70** All anhydrous ammonia installations are subject to inspection at any time by any duly-authorized officer of the Commission.



**71** The owning or operating company shall report by wire to the railway company and the Director of Operation, Canadian Transport Commission, Ottawa, every fire resulting in damage to the installation, explosion, or major pipeline or tank failure occurring on the installation, and shall submit a detailed report by mail.



**72** Welding shall not be permitted within 100 feet of a loading or unloading site while loading or unloading operations are in progress. At other times, welding shall only be allowed when carried out under close supervision and in accordance with the provisions of Canadian Standards Association pamphlet W-117.



**73** 

- **(1)** Each storage area with a water capacity exceeding 2,000 Imperial gallons should be protected by at least one standard fire hydrant so located that a 2½-inch hose stream may be used for controlling a fire on the site or for cooling a tank in case of adjacent fires. Consultation with the local fire authority is recommended.

- **(2)** Fire extinguishers suitable for small fires shall be available on installations with a storage capacity exceeding 2,000 Imperial gallons. At least one fire extinguisher shall be kept on the outside premises.



**74** The principal hazards associated with the handling of anhydrous ammonia are as follows:
- **(a)** mixtures of air and anhydrous ammonia consisting of 16 to 25 per cent by volume of anhydrous ammonia are flammable and may ignite at a temperature as low as 1204°F in the presence of iron. For outdoor installations, this condition is not likely to be obtained except as a result of a tank or pipeline rupture. However, serious fires and explosions have occurred in which anhydrous ammonia was a contributing factor. Anhydrous ammonia becomes slightly unstable at 840-930°F and dissociates into hydrogen and nitrogen. The presence of small quantities of oil or other combustible material in anhydrous ammonia will increase the fire hazard;
- **(b)** 100 p.p.m. is the maximum average atmospheric concentration of ammonia to which workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse effect on their health. Exposure to concentrations of 250 p.p.m. for 30 minutes is considered dangerous and an exposure of 30 minutes’ duration to concentrations of 5,000 p.p.m. is considered to be fatal. Industrial gas masks of a type approved for use in ammonia atmospheres should be located in a convenient place. Approximately 400 p.p.m. will cause immediate throat irritation and 700 p.p.m. will cause immediate eye irritation; and
- **(c)** in addition to the above-mentioned hazards, anhydrous ammonia is shipped and stored under pressure and those general safety precautions prescribed for the handling of compressed gases should be observed.



**75** Safety equipment, as prescribed in the current edition of Agricultural Ammonia Institute pamphlet, Standards for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia should be provided at all bulk storage installations.
