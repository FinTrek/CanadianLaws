- **(2)** Levies imposed by any order or regulation referred to in subsection (1) shall be established at such levels as to produce in each year a return to the Agency that is an amount sufficient to defray its administrative and marketing expenses and costs, as estimated by it, for the year.

- **(3)** The Agency, in estimating its administrative and marketing expenses and costs for a year, may allow for the creation of reserves, the payment of expenses and losses resulting from the sale or disposal of turkeys, equalization or adjustment payments among turkey producers based on moneys realized from the sale of turkeys during such period or periods of time as the Agency considers appropriate and any other expenses and costs deemed essential by the Agency for the realization of its objects.
