## General


**3** Insurance contracts shall be signed by, or bear the lithographed or facsimile signature of the Minister, and be countersigned by the Superintendent.
> SOR/88-130, s. 2(F).




**4** 

- **(1)** A period of 30 days grace is allowed for the payment of any premium after the first premium during which period the contract shall remain in full force, but if the insured dies within that period, any overdue premiums shall be deducted from the amount of insurance money payable.

- **(2)** If, after an insurance contract has been in force for at least two years, two or more annual premiums or their half-yearly, quarterly or monthly equivalents having been paid thereon, any premium is not paid on or before its due date and remains unpaid at the expiration of a period of 30 days following its due date, the contract shall thereupon be deemed to be changed to one of paid-up insurance for such amount as the net level premium reserve under the contract, calculated according to the H.M. Mortality Table of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain and a rate of interest of six per cent per annum, at the due date of the unpaid premium, will purchase when applied as at that date as a single premium on the basis of the said table of mortality and rate of interest.

- **(3)** Where a contract has been changed to one of paid-up insurance in accordance with subsection (2), and where less than five years have elapsed since the due date of the first unpaid premium, the contract may be reinstated to its original form if the insured pays all the overdue premiums and, if more than 90 days have elapsed since the due date of the first unpaid premium, also pays interest on the overdue premiums at a rate of six per cent per annum compounded annually from their respective due dates to the date of reinstatement and provides to the Minister evidence of insurability.

- **(4)** The insured may, with the consent of the beneficiary, surrender his insurance contract and there shall be paid to him upon such surrender a cash surrender value therefor equal to the level premium reserve under the contract calculated according to the H.M. Mortality Table of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain at a rate of interest of six per cent per annum.
