### Confusion of Names


**13** A corporate name is confusing with
- **(a)** a trade mark if the use of both the corporate name and the trade mark is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the corporate name and the business connected with the trade mark are one business, whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same; or
- **(b)** a trade name if the use of both names is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the corporate name and the business carried on under the trade name are one business, whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same.




### Consideration of Whole Name


**14** Subject to section 19, when determining whether a trade name is distinctive, the name as a whole and not only its separate elements shall be considered.




### Reservation of Name


**15** A request to search  and reserve a corporate name may be in Form 5 of Schedule I or may be made by telephone.

**20** For the purposes of section 11, a corporate name is prohibited where the name is confusing having regard to all the circumstances, including

- **(b)** the length of time the trade mark or trade name has been in use;
- **(c)** the nature of the goods or services associated with a trade mark or the nature of the business carried on under or associated with a trade name, including the likelihood of any competition among businesses using such a trade mark or trade name;

**22** For the purposes of section 11,
- **(a)** a corporate name is prohibited where its use is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under it and the business of a body corporate that is dissolved are one business, whether or not the nature of their businesses is generally the same; and
- **(b)** the name of a revived corporation is prohibited where it is confusing with a name acquired by another corporation between the date of dissolution and revival of the revived corporation.




### Deceptively Misdescriptive Names
