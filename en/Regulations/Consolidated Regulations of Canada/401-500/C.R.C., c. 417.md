## Examination


**39** 

- **(1)** The examination of any quantity of prepackaged products that are owned by a dealer, hereinafter referred to as a lot, each unit of which purports to contain the same net quantity of product, that an inspector undertakes to determine whether the lot meets the requirements of the Act and these Regulations respecting the declaration of net quantity, shall be made by selecting and examining a sample from the lot.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), where a lot contains the number of units set out in Column I of an item of Part I of Schedule II, an inspector shall select from the lot a number of units not less than the number set out in Column II of that item and the number of the units selected shall constitute the sample referred to in subsection (1).

- **(3)** Where, for the purpose of determining the net quantity, other than for establishing the weight of the container, it is necessary to destroy a certain number of units in the lot, an inspector shall select, for destruction, not more than 10 per cent of the total number of units in the lot and not less than one unit and the number of units selected shall constitute the sample referred to in subsection (1).

- **(4)** The lot from which a sample was taken and examined by an inspector does not meet the requirements of the Act and these Regulations respecting the declaration of net quantity where the inspector determines that
	- **(a)** the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample, as determined by the formula set out in Part II of Schedule II, is less than the declared net quantity;
	- **(b)** the number of units in the sample that contain less than the declared net quantity by more than the prescribed tolerance set out in Schedule I for that quantity is equal to or greater than the number set out in Column II of Part IV of Schedule II for the sample size set out in Column I thereof; or
	- **(c)** two or more units in the sample contain less than the declared net quantity by more than twice the prescribed tolerance set out in Schedule I for that quantity.

**PART II** 
## Formula for Determining the Weighted Average Quantity of the Units in a Sample

For the purposes of paragraph 39(4)(a), the formula for adjusting the sample mean to determine the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample is as follows
```

> Image: Formula for adjusting the sample mean to determine the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample

```
where
- X<sub>a</sub>is the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample
- xis the sample mean calculated as follows:
```
x = ∑x ÷ n
```

- **∑x** is the sum of the net quantities of all units in the sample
- **t** is the value determined in accordance with Part III for the selected sample size
- **n** is the number of units in the sample
- **s** is the standard deviation of the sample, calculated as follows
```

> Image: Formula for the standard deviation of the sample

```

- **∑(x-** x**)** <sup>2</sup>is the sum of the squared differences between the sample mean and the net quantity of each unit in the sample.

<sup>*</sup>: The value of (t ÷ √n) may, instead of being calculated in accordance with this Part, be determined using the applicable value set out in Column III of the table to Part III<br />

###### *Linear Interpolation of Values*


Where a sample size is selected that is not listed in Column I of this table and lies between 32 and 125, the value of t will be determined by linear interpolation as follows:
```

> Image: Formula for the value of t determined by linear interpolation where the sample size is not given in Column I of the Table For Values of t and (t/the square root of n) “in PART III and lies between 32 and 125”

```
where
- **a** is the value of t for the closest sample size below the selected sample size
- **b** is the value of t for the closest sample size above the selected sample size
- **c** is the result of 120 divided by the closest sample size below the selected sample size
- **d** is the result of 120 divided by the closest sample size above the selected sample size
- **e** is the result of 120 divided by the selected sample size
