## Additional Conditions of Authorization



### General


**6** The owner of a plant shall, for each type of effluent deposited by the plant,
- **(a)** install and maintain facilities, including sampling connections and flow measuring devices, of such type as the Minister may in writing approve for sampling and analysing effluents for the purpose of enabling the Minister to determine whether the owner is complying with the limits of authorized deposits prescribed by section 5;

- **(c)** analyse the sample referred to in paragraph (b) in accordance with section 9;
- **(d)** measure the flow in accordance with section 10; and
- **(e)** determine the actual and average daily deposits of each deleterious substance in accordance with section 11.




### Method of Collecting Composite Samples


**7** A composite sample shall be obtained by collecting effluent discharged from a plant during a processing day
- **(a)** continually during a sampling period of 24 hours at a rate in proportion to the flow rate of the effluent discharged; or
- **(b)** in such a manner that equal volumes of effluent are delivered into a receptacle at equal intervals not longer than one hour during a sampling period of 24 hours.




### Frequency of Sampling and Analysis


**8** The sampling referred to in paragraph 6(b) shall be made
