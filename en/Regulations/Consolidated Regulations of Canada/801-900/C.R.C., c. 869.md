After 24 hours, the area should be washed gently with soap and water. If no irritation or inflammation is apparent, it may be assumed that no hypersensitivity to the dye exists. The test should be made before each application. The hair dye should never be used for dyeing eyebrows or eyelashes, as severe inflammation of the eye or even blindness may result.
> SOR/89-228, s. 3; SOR/2004-244, s. 11.
