**17** No reference, direct or indirect, to the Act or these Regulations shall be made on any label or in any advertisement of a cosmetic unless the reference is a specific requirement of the Act or these Regulations.



**18** All information required by these Regulations to appear on the label of a cosmetic shall be
- **(a)** clearly and prominently displayed thereon; and
- **(b)** readily discernible to the purchaser or consumer under the customary conditions of purchase and use.



**19** Where a cosmetic has only one label, that label shall contain all the information required by these Regulations to be shown on both the inner and outer label thereof.



**20** Subject to these Regulations, the inner label of a cosmetic shall show
- **(a)** the name of the manufacturer or distributor of the cosmetic and the address of his principal place of business; and
- **(b)** the identity of the cosmetic in terms of its common or generic name or in terms of its function, unless the identity is obvious.



**21** 

- **(1)** No manufacturer shall, on any label or in any advertisement for a cosmetic, make any claim respecting
	- **(a)** the ability of the product or any ingredient thereof to influence the chemistry of the skin, hair or teeth, or
	- **(b)** product formulation, manufacture or performance that would imply that the user of the product will not suffer injury to health,

**22** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), no person shall sell a hair dye that contains paraphenylenediamine or other coal tar dye base or coal tar dye intermediate unless

This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows. To do so may cause blindness”

“*MISE EN GARDE : Ce produit contient des ingrédients qui peuvent causer de l’irritation cutanée chez certaines personnes; il faut donc d’abord effectuer une épreuve préliminaire selon les directives ci-jointes. Ce produit ne doit pas servir à teindre les sourcils ni les cils; en ce faisant, on pourrait provoquer la cécité*”; and


	- **(b)** instructions to the following effect, in both official languages, accompany each package of the hair dye;
		- **(i)** the preparation may cause serious inflammation of the skin in some persons and a preliminary test should always be carried out to determine whether or not special sensitivity exists, and
		- **(ii)** to make the test, a small area of skin behind the ear or on the inner surface of the forearm should be cleansed, using either soap and water or alcohol, and a small quantity of the hair dye as prepared for use should be applied to the area and allowed to dry. After 24 hours, the area should be washed gently with soap and water. If no irritation or inflammation is apparent, it is usually assumed that no hypersensitivity to the dye exists. The test should, however, be carried out before each application. On no account should the hair dye be used for dyeing eyebrows or eyelashes as severe inflammation of the eye or even blindness may result.

“*Mode d’emploi : Pour usage externe seulement. Employer modérément, pas plus d’une fois par jour. Vaporiser sur la surface externe de la peau en tenant le bec à une distance d’au moins huit pouces*”

“Caution: Do not apply internally or to broken, irritated or itching skin. Do not use when wearing a sanitary napkin. Discontinue use immediately if a rash or irritation develops. Consult a physician if the rash or irritation persists or if there is any unusual odour or discharge at any time”

“*Mise en garde : Ne pas appliquer sur une surface interne ou sur une surface éraflée, irritée ou en proie à la démangeaison. Ne pas utiliser avec des serviettes hygiéniques. Cesser immédiatement l’emploi en cas d’éruption ou d’irritation. Consulter un médecin si l’éruption ou l’irritation persiste ou en cas d’odeur ou de sécrétion inhabituelle*”





**24** 

- **(1)** No person shall sell a cosmetic presenting an avoidable hazard unless the label carries, in both official languages adequate directions for safe use.
