## Individual Contracts — Premium Series 3 and 4
## Integration with Old Age Security At Age 65

Monthly additional annuity for each $10 a month Old Age Security Pension. Take maturity age to years and completed months, and add the monthly difference times the number of months. For full monthly additional annuity multiply the resulting figure by the monthly Old Age Security Pension and divide by 10.


The last increased payment is the one falling due in the month for which Old Age Security is first payable.


This table applies to persons born in 1905 and after.

## Individual Contracts — All Immediate Annuities and Series 8 Matured
## Integration with Old Age Security At Age 65

Monthly additional annuity for each $10 a month Old Age Security Pension. Take maturity age to years and completed months, and add the monthly difference times the number of months. For full monthly additional annuity multiply the resulting figure by the monthly Old Age Security Pension and divide by 10.


The last increased payment is the one falling due in the month for which Old Age Security Pension is first payable.
