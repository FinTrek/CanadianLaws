		- **(vi)** not more than one per cent of the seeds designated as injurious in the Feeds Regulations except that there may be a total of two per cent of such seeds where the excess over one per cent is hare’s ear mustard or wild mustard (*Brassica Kaber*); and
	- **(d)** may contain wheat scourings.

- **(5)** Uncleaned Screenings shall be grain screenings that do not meet the specifications for No. 1 or No. 2 Feed Screenings because of the content of weed seeds, hulls, chaff or dust but that contain
	- **(a)** at least 35 per cent of material that if separated would meet the grade requirements for No. 1 Feed Screenings; and
	- **(b)** not more than one per cent of excessive wild oat hulls.

- **(6)** Refuse Screenings shall be grain screenings that do not meet the grade requirements for No. 1 or No. 2 Feed Screenings or Uncleaned Screenings because of the content of weed seeds, chaff or dust.

- **(7)** An inspector may include in the grade name of any screenings
