### **SCHEDULE IV** 
**(Sections 2, 10 and 12)**
## Measurement and Calculation of Actual Deposit of a Deleterious Substance Prescribed in Paragraph 4(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of Regulations
**1** The flow rates of all liquid effluents and once-through cooling water deposited by a refinery shall be measured and recorded continuously in Canadian gallons per minute.


**2** 

- **(1)** The concentration in milligrams per litre of a deleterious substance prescribed in paragraph 4(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) in composite samples obtained from each liquid effluent outfall and from the once-through cooling water shall be determined every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, or as requested by the Minister, using
	- **(a)** the test method referred to in Column II of an item of the table to this Schedule and modified as set out in Column III of that item in respect of the deleterious substance set out in Column I of that item; or
	- **(b)** any other equivalent method, approved in writing by the Minister, the results of which can be confirmed by the method referred to in paragraph (a).

- **(2)** For the purpose of subsection (1), a composite sample is
	- **(a)** the quantity of liquid effluent or once-through cooling water that is collected continually during a sampling period of 24 hours at a rate in proportion to the flow rate of the liquid effluent or once-through cooling water;
	- **(b)** the quantity of liquid effluent or once-through cooling water that is collected so that a minimum of 96 equal volumes of liquid are delivered into a receptacle at equal time intervals over a sampling period of 24 hours; or
	- **(c)** in the case where the use of continuous stream analyzers have been approved by the Minister, the liquid effluent or once-through cooling water itself.

- **(3)** For the purpose of this section, procedures pertaining to sampling, the preservation and storage of samples and the prevention of interference, as outlined in the general sections relating to the specific test methods set out in Column II of the table to this Schedule, should be adhered to.


**3** The actual deposit by a refinery of a deleterious substance prescribed in paragraph 4(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) shall be calculated by using the amounts obtained under sections 1 and 2 of this Schedule for each day that the concentration of that deleterious substance has been determined.


**4** The arithmetic mean of the actual deposits referred to in paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Regulations shall be calculated using the amounts obtained under section 3 of this Schedule.


**5** For the purpose of subsection 5(3) of the Regulations, the actual quantity of a deleterious substance prescribed in paragraph 4(a), (b) or (e) of the Regulations contained in storm water deposited each month shall be calculated using the weighted average concentration, based on the quantity of storm water discharged for those days during which the concentration of that deleterious substance has been determined, and the total quantity of storm water discharged in that month.
