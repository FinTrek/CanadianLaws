## Agreement Authorized


**3** 

- **(1)** Where an assistance agreement is in force, the Minister may enter into an agreement with the province to provide for the payment by Canada to the province of a contribution, calculated in accordance with these Regulations, in respect of the cost to the province and to municipalities in the province of benefits paid under a universal nursing home care benefit program of the province.

- **(2)** A universal nursing home care benefit program means a program, established pursuant to provincial law, that
	- **(a)** provides for, and is administered and operated so as to provide for, the payment by the province of benefits in respect of the cost of care provided in nursing homes in the province that are included in the program; and
	- **(b)** is administered and operated on the basis that the benefits referred to in paragraph (a) are available on uniform terms and conditions
		- **(i)** to every resident of a nursing home or part thereof that is included in the program,
		- **(ii)** to every such resident who is receiving a level of care specified by the province for the purposes of the program, or
		- **(iii)** to every such resident who is within an age group specified by the province for the purposes of the program,
without the requirement of a test of the financial circumstances of any person to determine whether or not that person is entitled to receive such benefits.

- **(3)** Notwithstanding subsection (2), a universal nursing home care benefit program described in that subsection includes a program that is administered and operated under terms and conditions that require
	- **(a)** all persons who receive the care referred to in paragraph (2)(a) to pay the same fixed amount representing a portion of the cost of such care;
	- **(b)** a period of residence in the province as a condition of eligibility for the benefits referred to in paragraph (2)(a);

	- **(d)** a test of the financial circumstances of any person to determine the ability of that person to pay the amount referred to in paragraph (a) or the premium referred to in paragraph (c).




## Calculation of Contributions


**4** The amount of the contribution payable by Canada to a province for a year is the amount obtained by multiplying the base year payment by the product of the cost increase factor and the population increase factor.



**5** For the purposes of section 4,
- **(a)** the cost increase factor is the quotient obtained by dividing the *per diem* cost of care determined by the Minister for the year for which a contribution is paid by the *per diem* cost of care determined by the Minister for the base year; and
- **(b)** the population increase factor is the quotient obtained by dividing
	- **(i)** an estimate of the number of persons in the total population of the province who were 65 years of age or over on October 1st of the year for which a contribution is paid
by
	- **(ii)** an estimate of the number of persons in the total population of the province who were 65 years of age or over on whichever of the following dates last precedes or represents the first day of the seventh month of the base year, namely, January 1st, April 1st, June 1st, July 1st or October 1st.



**6** The amount of the contribution payable by Canada to a province for an initial period is
- **(a)** in relation to any province other than the Province of Alberta, that proportion of the amount, as determined by the Minister, obtained by multiplying the base year payment by the product of the cost increase factor and the population increase factor that the initial period is of a year; and
- **(b)** in relation to the Province of Alberta, one-quarter of the base year payment.



**7** For the purposes of paragraph 6(a),
- **(a)** the cost increase factor is the quotient obtained by dividing the amount of the *per diem* cost of care for the period of computation comprising, at the election of the province,
	- **(i)** the initial period, or
	- **(ii)** the year during which the initial period began,
by the *per diem* cost of care for the base year; and
- **(b)** the population increase factor is the quotient obtained by dividing
	- **(i)** an estimate of the number of persons in the total population of the province who were 65 years of age or over on whichever of the following dates last precedes or represents the first day of the second half of the initial period as determined by the Minister, namely, January 1st, April 1st, June 1st, July 1st or October 1st,
by
	- **(ii)** an estimate of the number of persons in the total population of the province who were 65 years of age or over on whichever of the following dates last precedes or represents the first day of the seventh month of the base year, namely, January 1st, April 1st, June 1st, July 1st or October 1st.



**8** 

- **(1)** In sections 5 and 7, "*per diem* cost of care” means
	- **(a)** in respect of a year or an initial period for which a contribution is paid, the weighted average of the daily operating costs incurred for the care provided during that year or initial period in nursing homes included in a universal nursing home care benefit program of the province;
	- **(b)** in respect of the base year for any province other than the Province of Alberta, the weighted average of the daily operating costs incurred for the care provided during that base year in nursing homes that
		- **(i)** were listed, or were accepted for listing, as homes for special care in a schedule to an assistance agreement, and
		- **(ii)** were, upon the introduction of a universal nursing home care benefit program of the province, included in that program; and
	- **(c)** in respect of the base year for the Province of Alberta, the weighted average of the daily operating costs incurred for the care provided during that base year in nursing homes that, during the base year, were included in a universal nursing home care benefit program of the Province.

- **(2)** In subsection (1), “operating costs” means that portion of the total operating costs of a nursing home that may, in accordance with recognized and generally accepted accounting principles, be properly considered as having been incurred for the care of residents therein.
