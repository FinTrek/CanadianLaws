	- **(a)** an auxiliary steering gear capable of being readily connected to the tiller and, in the case of a ship of that category fitted with twin rudders operated by a single steering gear, an arrangement so that each rudder can be readily disconnected and secured; or
	- **(b)** an effective alternative means of steering the ship such as multiple propellers or side thrust arrangements.

- **(4)** Every Arctic class ship shall be fitted with ice horns directly abaft each rudder in such a manner that
