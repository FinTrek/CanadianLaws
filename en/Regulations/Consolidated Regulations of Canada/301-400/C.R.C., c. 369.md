The clerk has settled that the amount of $ _________________________ (weekly or monthly) be paid into court by the debtor to be distributed *pro rata* among the creditors once every three months.


If you have any objection to the amount as acknowledged as owing to you or any creditor, or to the manner of, or the amount of payment, or to any of the facts set out above, return the attached form to the court within twenty days from the date hereof, stating fully your objections. Any objections will be heard by the clerk at his office in the Court House at _________________________ on the _________________________ day of _________________________ 20_________________________ at the hour of _________________________. You will, prior to that date, be notified of any objections filed by other creditors in connection with the application.


If you do not file any objection within the time stated, the amount acknowledged as owing to you by the debtor will become a judgment of the court in full settlement of his debt, and the manner of payment will become an order of the court.


NOTE: *If the debt as acknowledged to you is secured, you may, at any time, elect to rely on your security in the manner provided for in section 232 of the Act, a copy of that section being set out below:*

**“232. (1)** A registered creditor holding security for a claim may, at any time, elect to rely on his security notwithstanding that the claim is included in a consolidation order.



**(2)** Where the proceeds from the disposal of the security referred to in subsection (1) are in excess of the registered creditor’s claim, the excess shall be paid into court and applied in payment of other judgments against the debtor.



**(3)** Subsection (2) does not apply where the security is in the form of chattels exempt from seizure under any law in force in the province in which the consolidation order was issued.



**(4)** Where the proceeds from the disposal of the security referred to in subsection (1) are less than the registered creditor’s claim, the creditor remains entitled to the balance of his claim.



**(5)** Subsection (4) does not apply in a case where, under the law in force in the province in which the consolidation order was issued, a creditor

**(a)** who enforces his security by repossession or repossession and sale, or



**(b)** who seizes and sells the security under an execution issued pursuant to a judgment obtained against the debtor in respect of the claim so secured,



is limited in his recovery of the claim to the security so repossessed or the proceeds of the sale thereof.”






*If you elect to rely on your security, you must immediately place a fair value on the goods so repossessed and notify the court of this valuation at once.*


*If the value exceeds the amount owing to you, then you are ordered to pay the excess of that value upon realization as to which you are required to exercise due diligence.*
