**1** Persons who are or have been subject to the legislation of one Party, as well as other persons who derive rights from such persons, who ordinarily reside in the territory of the other Party, shall receive equal treatment with nationals of that other Party in the application of the legislation of that other Party. However, the foregoing shall not affect the provisions on complementary periods for Japanese nationals on the basis of ordinary residence outside the territory of Japan under the legislation of Japan.



**2** Any provision of the legislation of one Party which restricts entitlement to or payment of benefits solely because the person ordinarily resides outside or is absent from the territory of that Party shall not be applicable to persons who ordinarily reside in the territory of the other Party. However, the foregoing shall not affect:

**(a)** the provisions of the legislation of Japan which require a person who is aged 60 or over but under 65 on the date of the first medical examination or of death to reside ordinarily in the territory of Japan for the acquisition of entitlement to the Disability Basic Pension or the Survivors’ Basic Pension;



**(b)** the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada which require that a person have completed a prescribed minimum period of residence in Canada in order for that person to be entitled to the payment of a pension when he or she is outside the territory of Canada for an indefinite period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph, the requirement of that Act regarding a prescribed minimum period of residence in Canada for the purpose of the payment of a pension to a person who is outside the territory of Canada shall be fulfilled, when required, through the totalization of periods of residence in Canada and periods of coverage under the legislation of Japan in accordance with paragraph 3 and subparagraph 4(a) of Article 6; and





**(c)** the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada regarding the payment of an allowance and a guaranteed income supplement to a person who is outside the territory of Canada, and any other similar benefits, to be introduced after the entry into force of this Agreement, and as may be agreed upon between the two Parties.





**3** A benefit under the legislation of one Party which is payable to a person who is or has been subject to the legislation of the other Party, as well as other persons who derive rights from such a person, shall be paid when that person or those persons ordinarily reside in the territory of a third State under the same conditions as it would to a national of the first Party who ordinarily resides in the territory of that third State.



**ARTICLE 5** 
## Provisions concerning the Applicable Legislation

**2** Subject to paragraph 5 of this Article, where a person who is covered under the legislation of one Party and normally employed in the territory of that Party by an employer with a place of business in that territory is sent by that employer from that territory to work in the territory of the other Party, the employee shall, with respect to that employment, be subject only to the legislation of the first Party as if that employee were working in the territory of the first Party, provided that the period of such detachment is not expected to exceed five years. If the detachment continues beyond five years, the competent authority or competent institution of the second Party may, with the prior concurrence of the competent authority or competent institution of the first Party, grant further exemption of the employee from the legislation of the second Party. For the purpose of this paragraph in the case of an employee who is sent from the territory of Canada by an employer in that territory to a related company of that employer in the territory of Japan, that employer and the related company of that employer shall be deemed to be the same employer, provided that the employment is covered under the legislation of Canada.



**3** Paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply where a person who has been sent by an employer from the territory of one Party to the territory of a third State is subsequently sent by that employer from the territory of the third State to the territory of the other Party.



**4** Where a person covered under the legislation of one Party, who ordinarily works as a self-employed person in the territory of that Party, works temporarily as a self-employed person in the territory of the other Party, that self-employed person shall, with respect to that self-employment, be subject only to the legislation of the first Party as if that self-employed person were working in the territory of the first Party, provided that the period of such self-employment in the territory of the second Party is not expected to exceed five years. If that self-employment continues beyond five years, the competent authority or competent institution of the second Party may, with the prior concurrence of the competent authority or competent institution of the first Party, grant further exemption of that self-employed person from the legislation of the second Party.

**6** The competent authority or competent institution of Japan and the competent authority of Canada may agree to grant an exception to the provisions of this Article in the interest of particular persons or categories of persons, provided that such persons or categories of persons shall be subject to the legislation of one of the Parties.



**7** As regards the accompanying spouse or children of a person who works in the territory of Japan and who is subject to the legislation of Canada in accordance with paragraph 2, 4, 5(b) or 6 of this Article:

That person’s spouse or common-law partner and dependants who reside with him or her shall be considered to be subject to the legislation of Japan during a period in which that person’s spouse or common-law partner and dependants are present or reside in the territory of Japan only if that person’s spouse or common-law partner and dependants are covered as Category II insured persons under the National Pension during that period;

**4** 

**(a)** For the purpose of establishing entitlement to benefits under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) through the application of paragraph 3 of this Article, the competent institution of Canada shall:

**(b)** Subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall also apply to a person who is outside the territory of Canada and who would be entitled to a full pension if he or she were in the territory of Canada, but whose period of residence in Canada is less than the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside the territory of Canada.

**(a)** Where a person does not have sufficient periods of coverage to fulfill the requirements for entitlement to benefits under the legislation of Japan, the competent institution of Japan shall take into account, for the purpose of establishing entitlement to benefits under this Article, periods of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).



**(b)** Subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following benefits under the legislation of Japan:

**(a)** the competent institutions of Japan shall credit, in each calendar year, twelve months of periods of coverage for a period of coverage of a year under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) and certified as such by the competent institution of Canada. Periods of coverage to be credited by the competent institutions of Japan shall not include months that are already credited as periods of coverage under the legislation of Japan. The total number of months of periods of coverage to be credited under the provision of this subparagraph and the months that are already credited as periods of coverage under the legislation of Japan shall not exceed twelve in a calendar year; and



**(b)** periods of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be taken into account as both periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees and periods of coverage for Category II insured persons under the National Pension.





**3** 

**(a)** Where the legislation of Japan requires for entitlement to disability pensions or survivors’ pensions that the date of the first medical examination or of death lie within specified periods of coverage, this requirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled for the purpose of establishing entitlement to those pensions, if such a date lies within a period of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).

However, if entitlement to disability pensions or survivors’ pensions under the National Pension is established without applying this paragraph, this paragraph shall not be applied for the purpose of establishing entitlement to disability pensions or survivors’ pensions based on the same insured event under the Japanese pension systems for employees.





**(b)** In applying subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, as regards a person who possesses periods of coverage under two or more Japanese pension systems for employees, the requirement referred to in that subparagraph shall be deemed to be fulfilled for one of those pension systems in accordance with the legislation of Japan.





**4** Where entitlement to a benefit under the legislation of Japan is established by virtue of subparagraph 1(a) or 3(a) of this Article, the competent institution of Japan shall calculate the amount of that benefit in accordance with the legislation of Japan, subject to paragraphs 5 to 9 of this Article.



**5** With regard to the Disability Basic Pension and other benefits, the amount of which is a fixed sum granted regardless of the period of coverage, if the requirements for receiving such benefits are fulfilled by virtue of subparagraph 1(a) or 3(a) of this Article, the amount to be granted shall be calculated according to the proportion of the sum of the periods of contribution and the premium-exempted periods under the pension system from which such benefits will be paid to the theoretical period of coverage referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article.



**6** With regard to disability pensions and survivors’ pensions under the Japanese pension systems for employees, insofar as the amount of those pensions to be granted is calculated on the basis of the specified period determined by the legislation of Japan when the periods of coverage under those systems are less than that specified period, if the requirements for receiving such pensions are fulfilled by virtue of subparagraph 1(a) or 3(a) of this Article, the amount to be granted shall be calculated according to the proportion of the periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees to the theoretical period of coverage referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article. However, when the theoretical period of coverage exceeds that specified period, the theoretical period of coverage shall be regarded as equal to that specified period.



**7** For the purpose of paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Article, ***theoretical period of coverage*** means the sum of the following periods (except that it shall not include the period after the month in which the day of recognition of disability occurs or the period beginning with the month in which the day following the day of death occurs):

**(a)** the period from the month in which the day of attainment of age 20 occurs through the month preceding the month in which the day of attainment of age 60 occurs, except the period before April 1, 1961;



**(b)** periods of contribution under the legislation of Japan which do not coincide with the period referred to in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph; and



**(c)** periods of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) which do not coincide with periods referred to in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, in case the month in which the day of recognition of disability occurs or the month preceding the month in which the day following the day of death occurs is before the period referred to in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.





**8** With regard to the calculation of the amount of benefits under the Japanese pension systems for employees in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Article, if the person entitled to the benefits possesses periods of coverage under two or more such pension systems, the periods of contribution referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article or the periods of coverage referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article shall be the sum of the periods of coverage under all such pension systems. However, when the sum of the periods of coverage equals or exceeds the specified period determined by the legislation of Japan within the meaning of paragraph 6 of this Article, the method of calculation stipulated in paragraph 6 of this Article and this paragraph shall not apply.



**9** With regard to the Additional Pension for Spouses which is included in the Old-age Employees’ Pension and any other benefits that may be granted as a fixed sum in cases where the period of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees equals or exceeds the specified period determined by the legislation of Japan, if the requirements for receiving such benefits are fulfilled by virtue of subparagraph 1(a) of this Article, the amount to be granted shall be calculated according to the proportion of the periods of coverage under the Japanese pension systems for employees from which such benefits will be paid to that specified period.



**ARTICLE 8** 
## Role of the Competent Authorities
