**PART II** 
## Specific Provisions Concerning Each Category of Benefits


**SECTION 1** 
### Disability


**ARTICLE X** 


**1** For nationals of either Contracting State who go from one State to the other, insurance or assimilated periods completed under the social security plans of the first State shall be totalized, pursuant to Article XII, with insurance or assimilated periods completed under the plans of the other State to the extent necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements of contributory or insurance periods of the legislation of the State where the disability occurs, both in order to determine eligibility for disability insurance cash benefits (pensions) or benefits in kind (care) and to maintain or regain this right.



**2** If the interruption of work and the disability which follows occur in Canada, the disability pension shall be determined and paid in accordance with the legislation of the State to which the interested person was subject at the time. The competent authority of Canada shall take into account the periods totalized in accordance with the preceding paragraph in calculating the benefit.



**3** If the interruption of work and the disability which follows occur in France, the disability pension shall be determined and paid as applicable, with respect to the legislation of both Contracting States.

Nevertheless, if eligibility under the legislation of Canada is established only through the application of paragraph 1, the competent authority of Canada shall not be required to pay the benefit in the territory of France.





**ARTICLE XI** 


**1** The institution or authority paying the pension shall notify the institution or authority of the other State of the suspension or cancellation of the pension.



**2** In the event that the insured person, after suspension of the disability pension, re-establishes eligibility for that pension, payment of the benefits shall be resumed by the institution or authority responsible for paying the pension originally granted.



**3** If after cancellation of the pension, the state of health of the insured person warrants the granting of a new disability pension, the rules established by Article X shall be applicable.



**SECTION 2** 
### Old Age and Survivors (Pensions)


#### Eligibility for Benefits


**ARTICLE XII** 


A national of France or Canada who has been subject in succession or alternately to the old age insurance plans of each Contracting State shall receive benefits under the following conditions:

**I** If the interested person meets the eligibility requirements for benefits under the legislation of both States, the competent institution or authority of each Contracting State shall determine the amount of the benefit in accordance with the provisions of the legislation which it is applying, taking into account only the insurance periods completed under that legislation.



**II** Where the requirements of duration of insurance for eligibility under neither State’s legislation are met by the interested person, the benefits which may be claimed from the institutions or authorities applying the legislation shall be determined and paid in accordance with the following rules:

**A** Totalization of Periods

**(1)** For the purposes of applying the legislation of France and of Canada, all of the insurance or assimilated periods shall be totalized to the extent necessary, provided they do not overlap, in order to establish eligibility for benefits and to maintain or regain this eligibility.



**(2)** The periods assimilated with insurance periods shall be, in each State, those which are recognized as such or credited under the legislation of the State.



The general administrative arrangement will set out the rules to follow in the case of overlapping periods.





**B** Determination of the Benefit Payable

**(1)** Taking into account the totalization of periods carried out as described above, the competent institution or authority of each State shall determine, in accordance with its own legislation, whether the interested person fulfills the eligibility requirements for an old age benefit under that legislation.



**(2)** When entitlement to a pension is established, the competent institution or authority of each State shall determine, theoretically, where necessary, the amount of the benefit to which the insured person would be eligible if all the insurance periods or periods considered equivalent, totalized in accordance with the rules set out in subparagraph II A, had been completed exclusively in accordance with its own legislation.



**(3)** The benefit actually payable to the interested person by the competent institution or authority of each State shall be established by prorating the amount of the benefit calculated in subparagraph II B(2) on the basis of the ratio of the insurance or assimilated periods completed under its own legislation to the total of the insurance or assimilated periods completed in the two States, totalized in accordance with the above rules.







**III** When entitlement is acquired under the legislation of one of the two Contracting States taking into account only the periods completed under that legislation, the competent institution or authority of that State shall determine the amount of the benefit as set out in subparagraph I.

The competent institution or authority of the other State shall proceed with the determination and payment of the benefit for which it is responsible under the conditions set out in subparagraph II.







#### Minimum Duration of Insurance for the Application of this Section


**ARTICLE XIII** 


**1** When totalization is required, if the total duration of insurance periods completed under the legislation of one Contracting State is less than one year, the institution or authority of that State need not grant benefits in respect of such periods unless, by virtue of these periods alone, entitlement to a benefit is acquired under that legislation. In this event, the amount of the benefit shall be determined definitively, taking into consideration such periods alone.



**2** Nevertheless, such periods may be taken into account to establish eligibility, by totalization, with respect to the legislation of the other Contracting State.



#### Cases of Successive Application of Legislation


**ARTICLE XIV** 


**1** When the interested person does not fulfill, at a given time, the requirements of the legislation of both Contracting States, but fulfills the requirements of only one of them, or fulfills the requirements of both States, but has taken the opportunity provided by the legislation of one of the States to defer the determination and payment of his benefit entitlements, the amount of the benefits payable under the legislation in respect of which entitlements are determined shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article XII, subparagraph I or III as applicable.



**2** When the requirements of the legislation of the other Contracting State are fulfilled or when the insured person requests the determination and payment of the entitlements which he deferred with respect to the legislation of one of the Contracting States, the determination of the benefits payable under the legislation shall be carried out in accordance with Article XII, without the need to revise the entitlements already determined and payable under the legislation of the first State.



#### Specific Provisions for the Application of the Legislation of France: Special Social Security Plans


**ARTICLE XV** 


**1** Where, for the purposes of the legislation of France, the granting of certain old age advantages is made conditional upon the insurance periods having been completed in a profession covered by a special plan, or, where applicable, in a specified profession or work, the periods completed in Canada shall be taken into account for the granting of these advantages only if they were completed in the same profession or, where applicable, in the same work.



**2** If, considering the periods completed in this way, the interested person does not fulfill the requirements for receipt of these advantages, these periods shall be taken into account for the granting of benefits under the general plan, regardless of the specific nature of such periods.



#### Specific Provisions for the Application of the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE XVI** 


The following specific provisions apply with respect to the application of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada:

**(c)** For the purposes of subparagraph II A(1) of Article XII, any reference to insurance periods shall read “residence periods” and residence periods completed in the territory of France after January 1, 1966 shall be considered residence periods in the territory of Canada.



**(d)** If entitlement to a pension is acquired as specified in Article XII, subparagraph II A, the competent authority shall calculate the amount of the pension payable in accordance with the provisions of its legislation, directly and exclusively with reference to the periods completed under the terms of that legislation.

When the total of the periods credited in accordance with subparagraph II A of Article XII is not at least 10 years, Canada is not required to pay an old age pension, under the terms of this Article, and when the total is not at least 20 years, Canada is not required to pay an old age pension, under the terms of this Article, in the territory of France.

**(b)** they fulfill, in that State, the requirements for the granting of those benefits.





**ARTICLE XIX** 


Where the condition of duration of insurance, provided by the legislation of the new State of employment, to obtain entitlement to allowances, is not fulfilled, and in order to complement the insurance or assimilated periods completed in that State, the insurance or assimilated periods completed by the worker in the other State may be used, to the extent necessary, to satisfy the minimum contributory period requirements of the legislation of the State where the death occurs.

Upon the signing on this date of the Agreement on Social Security between the Government of Canada and the Government of the French Republic,



Considering that in Canada:

**—** nationals of France are entitled to benefits under the Old Age Security program on the same basis as other residents of Canada, and



**—** nationals of France, including students, have access to the network of Canadian provincial social assistance services without restriction as to nationality,



it has been agreed that the following provisions shall apply in France:

**1** *Allowance for Elderly Employees*

The allowance for elderly employees shall be granted, under the conditions provided in the legislation of France on elderly employees, to elderly Canadian employees with insufficient resources who, at the time of application, have at least 15 years of uninterrupted residence in France.





**2** *Old Age Allowance for Self-Employed*

Nationals of Canada who having pursued in France a self-employed activity covered by an old age allowance plan referred to in Part I of Volume VIII of the Social Security Code, had never contributed to that program, shall have access to the non-contributory old age allowance for the self-employed on the same basis as nationals of France subject to their establishing that they have resided in France for a total of at least 15 years after age 20 and have resided normally in France for at least five years without interruption at the time of application for benefits.





**3** *Special Allowance*

Nationals of Canada shall have access to the special allowance provided for in Part II of Volume VIII of the Social Security Code on the same basis as nationals of France subject to their establishing that they have resided in France for a total of at least 15 years after age 20 and have resided normally in France for five years without interruption at the time of application for benefits.





**4** *National Solidarity Fund Supplementary Allowance*

Nationals of Canada entitled to an old age or disability benefit from a French plan for employees, within the framework of the legislation referred to in Article V of the Agreement on Social Security of February 9, 1979, or of one of the benefits referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Protocol, are entitled to the Supplementary Allowance under the same conditions as nationals of France.



The allowances referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this Protocol cease to be paid when the beneficiaries leave French territory.





**5** *Social Security for Students*

The French social security plan for students established by Volume VI in Part I of the Social Security Code is applicable, under the same conditions as for French students, to Canadian students who pursue their studies in France and who are neither covered by social insurance in that State nor dependants of a person so covered.





**6** *General Provisions*

For the application of resource-related provisions established by the legislation of one of the States the competent services and agencies of the other State will extend their cooperation with a view to:

**(a)** determining the resources available to the applicants, such as lifetime benefits derived from the social security plan and, to this effect, to conduct an investigation or inquiry in accordance with the conditions set out in the social security legislation;



**(b)** evaluating the goods they possess;



**(c)** approaching, if necessary, the persons who have a basic obligation to maintain the applicants concerned.





The provisions of this Protocol will take effect from the date the Agreement enters into force.
