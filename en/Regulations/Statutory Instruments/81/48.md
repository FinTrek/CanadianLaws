Now Know You that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our Proclamation give notice that the said Agreement between Canada and Barbados for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital, came into force on December 22, 1980.
