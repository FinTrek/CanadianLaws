A Proclamation

Whereas in and by section 7 of the Canada-Australia Income Tax Convention Act, 1980, assented to on April 23, 1981, being Part II of chapter 56 of the Statutes of Canada, 1980-81, it is provided that notice of the day the Convention comes into force and of the day it ceases to be effective shall be given by proclamation of the Governor in Council published in the Canada Gazette;

And Whereas Article 27 of the Convention provides that the Convention shall come into force on the date on which the Government of Australia and the Government of Canada exchange notes notifying each other that the last of such things has been done as is necessary to give the Convention the force of law in Australia and in Canada, as the case may be;

And Whereas the Government of Australia notified the Government of Canada on April 28, 1981 that all measures necessary to give the Convention the force of law within its jurisdiction are completed and the Government of Canada notified the Government of Australia on April 29, 1981 that its measures were also completed, the Convention accordingly entered into force on April 29, 1981;

Now Know You that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our Proclamation give notice that the said Convention between Canada and Australia for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income came into force on April 29, 1981.

Of All Which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.

In Testimony Whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent and the Great Seal of Canada to be hereunto affixed. Witness: The Honourable Julien Chouinard, a Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada and Deputy of Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved Edward Richard Schreyer, Chancellor and Principal Companion of Our Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Military Merit upon whom We have conferred Our Canadian Forces’ Decoration, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.

At Ottawa, this twenty-sixth day of August in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty-one and in the thirtieth year of Our Reign.


<p>By Command,<br />KATHLEEN FRANCOEUR HENDRIKS<br />*Deputy Registrar General of Canada*<br /></p>
