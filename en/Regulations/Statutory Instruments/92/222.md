----------

Whereas the Security Council of the United Nations, by Resolution 794 of December 3, 1992, determined that the magnitude of the human tragedy caused by the conflict in Somalia, further exacerbated by the obstacles being created to the distribution of humanitarian assistance, constitutes a threat to international peace and security;

Whereas the Security Council of the United Nations, by that Resolution and acting under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, called on member states to provide military forces and to use all necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia;

And Whereas it appears advisable that Canada participate in action pursuant to Resolution 794 and to take such other actions as may be appropriate under the United Nations Charter;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to paragraph 31(1)(b) of the [National Defence Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/N/N-5.md), is pleased hereby to place on active service beyond Canada those

**(a)** officers and non-commissioned members of the regular force of the Canadian Forces, and



**(b)** officers and non-commissioned members of the reserve force of the Canadian Forces



who are part of, or serve in immediate support of, the multinational military effort in and around Somalia.
