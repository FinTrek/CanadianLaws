**3** For the purposes of determining the entitlement of a person for a benefit, other than a death grant, under the legislation of Ireland,

**2** These periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent authority of the other Party to determine eligibility for benefits under the legislation of that Party through the application of Article VIII.



**CHAPTER 2** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE X** 
### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of a pension or spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1 of this Part, the competent authority of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.


**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person who is entitled to the payment of a pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,

**(a)** the competent authority of Canada shall not be liable to pay an Old Age Security pension outside Canada unless the periods of residence in Canada and in Ireland, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1 of this Part, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** the spouse’s allowance and the guaranteed income supplement shall be paid outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE XI** 
### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1 of this Part, the competent authority of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of such benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Ireland


**ARTICLE XII** 

**1** If a person is not entitled to an Irish benefit under the legislation of Ireland alone and the totalisation provisions of this Agreement are invoked, the person’s entitlement to benefit shall be determined by the competent authority of Ireland on the basis of the totalised periods in accordance with the relevant statutory contribution conditions provided for under the legislation of Ireland and the aforesaid competent authority shall calculate the amount of Irish benefit, other than death grant and orphan’s (contributory) allowance in accordance with the following formula:

**(a)** the amount of the theoretical benefit exclusive of any increase or additional allowance other than an increase for an adult dependant which would be payable if all the periods reckonable under the legislation of both Parties had been completed under its own legislation and



**(b)** the proportion of such theoretical benefit which bears the same relation to the whole as the total of the reckonable periods completed under the legislation of Ireland bears to the total of reckonable periods completed under the legislation of both Parties.



The proportionate amount thus calculated shall be the rate of benefit payable to that person by the competent authority of Ireland.




**2** In the case of death grant and orphan’s (contributory) allowance, entitlement to benefit and the amount of benefit payable shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant contribution conditions under the legislation of Ireland taking account of the provisions in Article VIII(4) in the case of a death grant.


**3** For the purposes of applying the foregoing paragraphs:

**(a)** where a compulsory or voluntary insurance period completed under the legislation of Ireland coincides with a reckonable period under the legislation of Canada, only the insurance period under the legislation of Ireland shall be taken into account; and



**(b)** where a period in respect of which contributions have been credited under the legislation of Ireland coincides with a reckonable period under the legislation of Canada, the insurance period under the legislation of Ireland shall not be taken into account.




**4** Any period of continuous incapacity for work which occurs while the person is resident in Canada shall be deemed to be a period of continuous incapacity for work under the legislation of Ireland for the purposes of determining if a person is permanently incapable of work.

**2** Any acts or documents of an official nature required to be produced for the application of this Agreement shall be exempt from any authentication by diplomatic or consular authorities and similar formalities.

**2** A claim for a benefit under the legislation of one Party shall be deemed to be a claim for the corresponding benefit under the legislation of the other Party, provided that the applicant:

**(b)** provides information at the time of application indicating that reckonable periods have been completed under the legislation of the other Party.
