Whereas subsection 3(1) of the [Referendum Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2030.md), being chapter 30 of the Statutes of Canada, 1992, provides that where the Governor in Council considers that it is in the public interest to obtain by means of a referendum the opinion of electors on any question relating to the Constitution of Canada, the Governor in Council may, by proclamation, direct that the opinion of electors be obtained by putting the question to the electors of Canada or of one or more provinces specified in the proclamation at a referendum called for that purpose;

Whereas, pursuant to section 4 of that Act, no proclamation may be issued before the text of the referendum question has been approved under section 5 of that Act;

Whereas the text of the referendum question hereinafter set out was approved by the House of Commons under section 5 of that Act on September 10, 1992 and was concurred in thereunder by the Senate on September 15, 1992;

And Whereas, by Order in Council P.C. 1992-2045, of September 17, 1992, the Governor in Council, considering that it is in the public interest to do so, has ordered that a proclamation do issue directing that the opinion of electors be obtained by means of a referendum on the question hereinafter set out relating to the Constitution of Canada;

Now Know You that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our Proclamation, direct that the opinion of electors be obtained by putting to the electors of the provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Newfoundland, the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, at a referendum called for that purpose, the following question relating to the Constitution of Canada:

“Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on August 28, 1992?

Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No”

Of All Which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.

In Testimony Whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent and the Great Seal of Canada to be hereunto affixed. Witness: Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved Ramon John Hnatyshyn, a Member of Our Privy Council for Canada, Chancellor and Principal Companion of Our Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Military Merit, One of Our Counsel learned in the law, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.

At Our Government House, in Our City of Ottawa, this seventeenth day of September in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two and in the forty-first year of Our Reign.
