Whereas, pursuant to subsection 3(1) of the [Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-3.md) (“the Act”), it is provided that the Governor in Council shall, on the occurrence of certain conditions, establish by proclamation, published in the Canada Gazette, for each decennial census an electoral boundaries commission for each province;

Whereas subsection 16(1) of the Fair Representation Act, which came into force on December 16, 2011, provides that, if that Act comes into force on or before the day on which the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (“the Minister”) receives a return certified by the Chief Statistician of Canada under subsection 13(1) of the Act in respect of the 2011 decennial census then, despite subsection 3(1) of the Act, the Governor in Council shall, for that decennial census, establish, for the purposes of the Act, by proclamation published in the Canada Gazette, a commission for each province no later than 60 days after the day on which the Minister receives the return;

Whereas the Minister received a copy of the return certified by the Chief Statistician of Canada under subsection 13(1) of the Act in respect of the 2011 decennial census on February 8, 2012;

Whereas section 4 of the Act provides that each commission for a province shall consist of three members, namely, a chairperson and two other members appointed as provided in sections 5 and 6 of the Act;

Whereas, pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of the Act, it is provided, among other obligations, that the chairperson of the commission for a province shall be appointed by the chief justice of that province or, in certain circumstances, by the Chief Justice of Canada, and that the two other members of the commission shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Commons;

Whereas the Minister has been notified, in accordance with section 7 of the Act, that each of the persons named in the annexed schedule, in accordance with section 8 of the Act, has been appointed pursuant to section 5 or 6 of the Act to an electoral boundaries commission for a province as set out in the schedule;

And whereas, by Order in Council P.C. 2012-86 of February 21, 2012, the Governor in Council directed that, for the 2011 decennial census, a proclamation do issue establishing the electoral boundaries commissions set out in the annexed schedule and that each commission consist of the persons who are appointed as provided in sections 5 and 6 of the Act and whose names are set out in the annexed schedule opposite the name of the commission;

NOW KNOW YOU that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our Proclamation establish the electoral boundaries commissions set out in the annexed schedule and that each commission consist of the persons who are appointed as provided in sections 5 and 6 of the [Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-3.md) and whose names are set out in the annexed schedule opposite the name of the commission.

OF ALL WHICH Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, We have caused this Our Proclamation to be published and the Great Seal of Canada to be hereunto affixed. WITNESS: The Honourable Andromahi Karakatsanis, a Puisne Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada and Deputy of Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved David Johnston, Chancellor and Principal Companion of Our Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Military Merit, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Merit of the Police Forces, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
