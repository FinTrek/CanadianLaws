### Schedule 1

## Superior Court of Justice Protocol – Allegations of Incompetence

**1** Before raising the incompetence or ineffective assistance of counsel, or that counsel otherwise contributed to a miscarriage of justice, appellate counsel has an obligation to satisfy themselves as soon as possible, by personal inquiry or investigation, that there is some factual foundation for the allegation, apart from the instructions of the appellant: *R. v. Elliott* (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont. C.A.), *R. v. Hofung* (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at paras. 47-48 (Ont. C.A.), *R. v. Wells* (2001), 139 O.A.C. 356 at para. 76.


**2** Appellate counsel should provide trial counsel, including duty counsel, with informal notice of the general nature of the potential allegations concerning ineffective assistance, and give counsel a reasonable opportunity to respond to the potential allegations. While not essential to permit trial counsel to respond (*R. v. Dunbar and Logan* (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.)), appellate counsel should seek a waiver in writing of solicitor-client privilege with respect to communications between the Appellant and trial counsel, insofar as it is necessary to preserve the professional integrity of counsel, while responding to the allegation. The waiver should be filed with the Notice of Appeal, or Supplementary Notice of Appeal.


**3** When appellate counsel decides to make the allegation public in a Notice of Appeal, Supplementary Notice of Appeal, Factum or affidavit, appellate counsel must first provide trial counsel with a copy of the document. Similarly, appellate counsel must provide trial counsel with a copy of subsequent documents that deal with the allegations.


**4** When the Notice of Appeal alleging the incompetence or ineffective assistance of counsel, or that counsel otherwise contributed to a miscarriage of justice, is filed, appellate counsel shall notify the clerk of the appeal court and the Crown Attorney or Federal Prosecutor that a judge is required to supervise the appeal.


**5** Where the Crown receives a Notice of Appeal in which the ineffective assistance of trial counsel etc. is raised by appellate counsel or an unrepresented litigant, and no request has been made for the appointment of a judge to supervise the appeal, the Crown shall notify the clerk of the appeal court that a judge is required to supervise the appeal.


**6** Upon receipt of a request for the appointment of a judge to supervise an appeal, the clerk of the appeal court shall transfer the appeal file to the Regional Senior Justice or his / her designate, to appoint a judge to supervise the appeal.


**7** A Crown Attorney shall be assigned to deal with all issues relating to the appeal, not later than the date upon which the request is made to appoint a judge to supervise the appeal.


**8** The assigned judge shall conduct conference(s) with counsel to supervise the subsequent progress of the perfection and argument of the appeal, and hear pre-appeal applications by counsel. The judge shall conduct the supervision in the manner that best accomplishes the objectives of fairness in dealing with allegations of professional incompetence, and the need to have appeals heard in a timely fashion. This may, but not necessarily must, involve the procedures covered in the Court of Appeal’s Procedural Protocol (Appendix A). Conferences with counsel representing both parties shall be held in chambers or by conference call, subject to the discretion of the assigned judge. Conferences with unrepresented litigants should be held in court with a court reporter present.


**9** Whether or not trial counsel has filed an affidavit, either party to the appeal may apply to the assigned judge to compel the appearance of trial counsel to be examined, either in or out of court, before the appeal.


**10** The assigned judge shall make rulings necessary to promote a full and fair hearing of the issues raised. For example, the assigned judge may rule on claims of privilege, the production to appellate and Crown Counsel of trial counsel’s file where necessary, requiring the attendance of trial counsel and others for examinations in or out of court before the hearing of the appeal, and costs associated with those attendances and transcript production, and the schedule and procedure for the examinations.

**PART I** 
## Particulars of the Case

**1** Place of conviction: 


**2** Name of Judge: 


**3** Offence(s) of which accused convicted: 


**4** Section(s) of [Criminal Code](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-46.md)<sup><a href='#F19_1'>[1]</a></sup> under which accused convicted: 

<a name='F19_1'><sup>1</sup></a>: Reference should be to the Criminal Code provision in force at the time of the commission of the offence.<br />


**5** Plea at trial: 


**6** Length of trial: 


**7** Sentence imposed: 


**8** Date of conviction: 


**9** Date of sentence: 


**10** Present place of incarceration (if applicable): 


**11** If Appellant released on bail pending appeal, date of release:<sup><a href='#F19_2'>[2]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_2'><sup>2</sup></a>: Note that subrule 40.10(3) requires that the release order be reproduced in the Appeal Book.<br />


**12** Period spent in pre-trial/pre-sentence incarceration?<sup><a href='#F19_3'>[3]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_3'><sup>3</sup></a>: Where the incarceration was due to circumstances other than detention on the charge(s) under appeal this should be made clear. Thus if for a period of the time the Appellant was serving sentence on another offence either this period should not be included or there should be a note to this effect.<br />


**13** Parole eligibility date:<sup><a href='#F19_4'>[4]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_4'><sup>4</sup></a>: This date is available from the sentence administrator of the institution where the Appellant is incarcerated. Where the Appellant is serving a sentence for offences other than the offence(s) under appeal this should be made clear in a note.<br />


**14** Name(s) of co-accused and sentence(s) imposed for offence(s) upon which he/they was/were convicted:<sup><a href='#F19_5'>[5]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_5'><sup>5</sup></a>: Where the Appellant relies on disparity as a ground for varying the sentence, additional details may be necessary and should be included in Part II of the Factum. These details would include the co-accused’s criminal record, reference to the trial judge’s reasons for the sentence imposed on the co-accused, the involvement of the co-accused, whether the co-accused was convicted of other offences so that the totality principle affected the sentence, and any other information providing context to the allegation of disparity.<br />


**15** Does Appellant have a prior criminal record?<sup><a href='#F19_6'>[6]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_6'><sup>6</sup></a>: If the Appellant has a prior criminal record, it should be set out in detail in Part II of the Factum.<br />


**16** Present employment: 


**17** Present marital status: 


**18** Appellant’s present age and age at time of offence:

<a name='F19_7'><sup>7</sup></a>: If there was a pre-sentence report prepared, its contents should be briefly summarized in Part II of the Factum. In addition, the entire pre-sentence report must be included in the Appeal Book.<br />


**20** Were there any medical, psychological, psychiatric or similar reports referred to or filed at the sentence proceedings?<sup><a href='#F19_8'>[8]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_8'><sup>8</sup></a>: Where relevant, the contents of such reports should be briefly summarized in Part II of the Factum. In addition, the complete report must be included in the Appeal Book, whether or not it was formally marked as an exhibit in the proceedings.<br />


**21** Was there a joint submission and if so what was it?<sup><a href='#F19_9'>[9]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_9'><sup>9</sup></a>: A joint submission would include where the solicitors have agreed on a range of sentence to be submitted to the trial judge.<br />


**22** If no joint submission briefly set out the position of the Crown and defence counsel on the sentence proceedings:<sup><a href='#F19_10'>[10]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_10'><sup>10</sup></a>: The “position” of the solicitors may simply be that the sentence should take a particular form, i.e. incarceration, or may be more specific, i.e. a specified term of months or years. If the solicitors did not make any suggestions as to the type or length of sentence this should be indicated as well.<br />


**23** Was there a victim impact statement?<sup><a href='#F19_11'>[11]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_11'><sup>11</sup></a>: If there was a victim impact statement, its contents should be briefly summarized in Part II of the Factum. If there was no victim impact statement but evidence was led as to the effect on the victim, this too should be briefly summarized in Part II of the Factum.<br />


**24** Will there be an application to admit fresh evidence and if so does the Respondent consent to its admission?<sup><a href='#F19_12'>[12]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_12'><sup>12</sup></a>: Where the Respondent consents to the admission of fresh evidence on the appeal, this evidence may be included in the Appeal Book or filed separately and reference may be made to the evidence in Part II of the Factum. No notice of application is required, provided that the material is clearly identified as fresh evidence and the Respondent has consented to its admission. Where the Respondent opposes the admission of fresh evidence, then the solicitor for the Respondent must prepare a notice of application returnable on the date of the appeal. The evidence itself should be filed with the notice of motion, but in a sealed envelope.<br />

## Summary of the Facts

*Facts of the* Offence:<sup><a href='#F19_13'>[13]</a></sup>

<a name='F19_13'><sup>13</sup></a>: Where the facts are complicated and somewhat lengthy, solicitors may wish to include a paragraph containing an overview of the facts. In most sentence appeals, that paragraph should not be necessary.<br />
