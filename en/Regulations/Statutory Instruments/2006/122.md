**ARTICLE 11** 
#### Periods Under the Legislation of the Republic of Latvia and Canada


**1** Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, if a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 5, provided the periods do not overlap.



**2 (a)** For purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of the Republic of Latvia shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.

**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or allowance under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of that Act governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada;

If a person is eligible for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
### Benefits Under the Legislation of the Republic of Latvia

**2** If, under the legislation of the Republic of Latvia, eligibility for a benefit can be established only through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of the Republic of Latvia:

**(a)** shall calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be paid if the totalized creditable periods had been accumulated under the legislation of the Republic of Latvia alone; and



**(b)** on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), shall determine the amount of benefit payable by applying the ratio of the length of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of the Republic of Latvia to the totalized creditable periods.





**ARTICLE 16** 
#### Entitlement and Payment of Benefits


**1** A person described in Article 3 who resides in Canada shall be entitled to benefits under the Act on State Pensions and the Act on State Funded Pensions under the same terms and conditions as if that person were residing in the Republic of Latvia.
