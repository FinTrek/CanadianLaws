**ARTICLE 8** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Slovenia


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** 

**(a)** For purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Slovenia shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.

**3** For purposes of determining eligibility for an old age pension under the legislation of Slovenia:

**(b)** a month which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a month which is creditable under the legislation of Slovenia.

**ARTICLE 9** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State


**1** If a citizen of a Party is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 8, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods completed under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.



**2** As regards the legislation of Canada, paragraph 1 shall apply to any person described in Article 3.



**ARTICLE 10** 
#### Minimum Period to be Totalized


Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under the legislation of that Party, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to pay a benefit to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**CHAPTER 2** 
### Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 11** 
#### Benefits under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md)


**1** If a person is eligible for an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 12** 
#### Benefits under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)


If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
### Benefits Under the Legislation of Slovenia


**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable


**1** If a person is eligible for a benefit under the legislation of Slovenia without the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Slovenia shall determine the amount of the benefit payable exclusively on the basis of the creditable periods which that person has completed under the legislation of Slovenia.



**2** If a person is eligible for a benefit under the legislation of Slovenia solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Slovenia shall calculate the amount of the benefit payable in the following manner:

**(a)** It shall first calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be payable if the total creditable periods had been completed under the legislation of Slovenia.



**(b)** On the basis of that theoretical amount, it shall then calculate the actual amount of the benefit payable according to the ratio between the creditable periods completed under its own legislation and the total creditable periods.



**(c)** In the application of sub-paragraph 2(a), only the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Slovenia shall be taken into account for determining the pension base for the calculation of the benefit.



**(d)** In the application of sub-paragraph 2(b), if the total duration of the creditable periods exceeds the maximum period to be taken into account under the legislation of Slovenia, the partial amount payable shall be calculated according to the ratio between the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Slovenia and the maximum period specified in that legislation.
