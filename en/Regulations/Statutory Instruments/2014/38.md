### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Section 2)**
## Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories Designated as a Reindeer Grazing Reserve
If topographic descriptions conflict with geographic coordinates, the topographic descriptions prevail.

Unless stated otherwise, all coordinates are in reference to North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83).


Any references to straight lines mean two points joined directly on a NAD 83 Universal Transverse Mercator projected plane surface.


For greater certainty and notwithstanding any topographic descriptions or geographic coordinates to the contrary, the northern coastal boundary of each Reserve, where applicable, shall follow a line marking the ordinary high-water mark of the northern coast of the mainland of the Northwest Territories.
