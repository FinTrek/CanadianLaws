Whereas the strength and courage demonstrated by our men and women in uniform serving on the battlefield and supported by personnel from other government departments have advanced the national interests of Canada in the fight against terrorism;

Whereas the families of our men and women of Her Majesty’s Canadian Armed Forces and Canadian communities from coast to coast to coast have admirably and consistently supported the sacrifices being made by those serving in Afghanistan;

Whereas it is desirable to build and strengthen an appreciation in Canadians for their contribution to the Afghanistan campaign and to promote the special role our families and communities play when our sons and daughters are in foreign lands;

And whereas it is desirable to recognize our appreciation for the sacrifice of all those who serve our great nation and all those who have paid the ultimate price for freedom;
