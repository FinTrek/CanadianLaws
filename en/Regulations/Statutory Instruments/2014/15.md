**PART III**
## Pensions


**Chapter 1**
### **Totalizing**


**ARTICLE 13** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Bulgaria**


**1** If a person is not eligible for a pension due to insufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, that person’s eligibility shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 5, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** To determine eligibility for:

**(a)** A pension under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Bulgaria shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada;



**(b)** A pension under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year with at least three months or 90 days which are creditable periods under the legislation of Bulgaria shall be considered as a year which is creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** To determine eligibility for old age, early retirement, or resulting survivor pensions under the legislation of Bulgaria:

**(a)** A calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as one year which is creditable under the legislation of Bulgaria;



**(b)** A creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which does not overlap with a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a creditable period under the legislation of Bulgaria.





**4** To determine eligibility for a disability pension or survivor pension derived from the right to a disability pension under the legislation of Bulgaria, a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a year which is creditable under the legislation of Bulgaria.



**5** If one Party’s legislation provides that a period is creditable for pension eligibility only when that period is completed in a specific activity or occupation; then that Party’s competent institution shall consider periods completed under the legislation of the other Party only when those periods are completed in that specific activity or occupation.



**ARTICLE 14** 
#### **Periods Completed in a Third State**


If a person is not eligible for a pension on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized in accordance with Article 13, the eligibility of that person for that pension shall be determined by totalizing these periods and periods completed under the program of a third State with which both Parties are bound by bilateral social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 15** 
#### **Minimum Period to be Totalized**


If the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, the right to a pension does not exist under the legislation of that Party, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to pay a pension in respect of those periods. These creditable periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent institution of the other Party to determine whether a person is eligible for the pension under the legislation of that Party through the application of Chapter 1.



**Chapter 2**
### **Pensions under the Legislation of Canada**


**ARTICLE 16** 
#### **Pensions under the Old Age Security Act**


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or allowance under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) based solely on the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in accordance with the provisions of that Act governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, based solely on the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act and this Agreement.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** A person who is outside of Canada shall be paid an Old age Security Pension only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized in accordance with Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**ARTICLE 17** 
#### **Pensions under the Canada Pension Plan**


If a person is eligible for a pension solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of pension payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the amount of the earnings-related portion of the pension shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), based solely on the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the pension shall be pro-rated by multiplying:

the amount of the flat-rate portion of the pension determined in accordance with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



the fraction representing the ratio of the periods of contribution to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that pension. That fraction shall not exceed the value of one.







**Chapter 3**
### **Pensions under the Legislation of Bulgaria**


**ARTICLE 18** 
#### **Calculating the Pension Payable**


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Bulgaria shall calculate the amount of pension payable according to the Bulgarian legislation only on the basis of Bulgarian creditable periods and according to the income on which insurance contributions have been paid during these periods.



**2** When determining the amount of an invalidity pension, the insurance period recognized for the time between the occurrence of invalidity and the date of acquiring the right to an old age pension under the Bulgarian legislation shall be reduced by the length of the periods of contribution completed under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) after the date of occurrence of invalidity.
