by



the fraction representing the ratio of the periods of contribution to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit.

**2** If entitlement to a pension is established solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of the Republic of Serbia:
