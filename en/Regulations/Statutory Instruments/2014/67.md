## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**Chapter I**
### **Totalizing**


**ARTICLE 11** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Brazil**


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because that person has not accumulated sufficient periods of coverage under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2. (a)** For the purpose of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a period of coverage under the legislation of Brazil shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada;

**(b)** For the purpose of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 3 months which are periods of coverage under the legislation of Brazil shall be considered as a year of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** For the purpose of determining eligibility for an old age benefit under the legislation of Brazil:

**(a)** A calendar year which is a period of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months of coverage under the legislation of Brazil;



**(b)** A month which is a period of coverage under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which does not overlap with a period of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a month of coverage under the legislation of Brazil.





**4** For the purpose of determining eligibility for a disability or death benefit under the legislation of Brazil, a calendar year which is a period of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months of coverage under the legislation of Brazil.



**ARTICLE 12** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of a Third State**


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the periods of coverage under the legislation of the Parties, totalized in accordance with Article 11, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and periods of coverage completed under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods, provided they do not overlap. In cases where periods of coverage completed under the legislation of a third State are applied by the competent institutions of both Parties, the periods shall not be counted twice.



**2** If a person is not eligible for a benefit under the legislation of Brazil on the basis of periods of coverage completed under the legislation of Brazil, totalized in accordance with Article 11, or with paragraph (1), the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing those periods and periods of coverage completed under the legislation of a third State with which only Brazil is bound by a social security instrument which provides for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 13** 
#### **Minimum Period for Totalization**


If the total of the periods of coverage accumulated under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, a right to a benefit does not exist under the legislation of that Party, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to pay a benefit in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement. These periods of coverage shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent institution of the other Party to determine eligibility for the benefits of that Party through the application of Chapter I.



**Chapter II**
### **Benefits under the Legislation of Canada**


**ARTICLE 14** 
#### **Benefits under the Old Age Security Act**


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or allowance under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in accordance with the provisions of that Act governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Canada shall pay an Old Age Security pension to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter I, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**ARTICLE 15** 
#### **Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan**


If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**1** the earnings-related portion of the benefits shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**2** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be pro-rated by multiplying:

**(a)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in accordance with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(b)** the fraction representing the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**Chapter III**
### **Benefits under the Legislation of Brazil**


**ARTICLE 16** 
#### **Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable**


**1** If a person is eligible for a benefit under the legislation of Brazil without the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I, the competent institution of Brazil shall determine the amount of the benefit payable exclusively on the basis of the periods of coverage which that person has completed under the legislation of Brazil.



**2** If a person is eligible for a benefit under the legislation of Brazil solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I, the competent institution of Brazil:

**(a)** shall calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be payable if the total periods of coverage had been completed under the legislation of Brazil;



**(b)** on the basis of that theoretical amount, shall then calculate the actual amount of the benefit payable according to the ratio between the periods of coverage completed under the legislation of Brazil and the total of the periods of coverage under the legislation of both Parties not to exceed the minimum period necessary to establish eligibility to the benefit;



**(c)** shall in no case apply sub-paragraph (a) so as to result in a theoretical benefit amount which is lower than the minimum guarantee provided under the legislation of Brazil.
