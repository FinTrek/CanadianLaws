**ARTICLE 8** 
### Creditable Periods under the Legislation of Jersey, Guernsey and Canada

**(1)** If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs (2) to (5) provided that the periods do not overlap.


**(2)** For the purposes of determining entitlement under the legislation of Jersey:

**(a)** to old age pension or widow’s benefits, a year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as an annual contribution factor of 1.00; and



**(b)** to old age pension, a week which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a weekly contribution factor of 0.0193.

**(a)** to old age pension or widow’s benefit, a year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 52 weeks of contributions; and



**(b)** to old age pension, a week which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a week of contributions.

**(b)** to a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a contribution year including an annual contribution factor of at least 0.25 under the legislation of Jersey, or at least 13 weeks of contributions under the legislation of Guernsey, shall be considered as a year for which contributions have been made under the Canada Pension Plan.




**(5)** For the purposes of applying the provisions of Article 14, the competent authority of Jersey or Guernsey shall take account only of creditable periods completed under the legislation of any Party which would be taken into account for the determination of pensions under the legislation of Jersey or Guernsey if they were completed under the appropriate legislation and shall, where appropriate, take into account in accordance with that legislation creditable periods completed by a spouse, or former spouse, as the case may be.



**ARTICLE 9** 
### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (4) of Article 2, if a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 8, entitlement to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods under the legislation of a third State with which either Jersey or Guernsey, as the case may be, and Canada are bound by social security instruments which provide for totalizing periods.



**ARTICLE 10** 
### Minimum Period to be Totalized

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of a Party is less than 52 weeks and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent authority of that Party shall not be required to award benefits in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.

**(3)** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** the old age security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Articles 8 and 9, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** the spouse’s allowance and the guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 12** 
### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan

If a person is entitled to a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Articles 8 and 9, the competent authority of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying (i) by (ii):

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md);



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.

**(a)** the amount of the theoretical pension which would be payable if all creditable periods completed under the legislation of all Parties had been completed under its own legislation;



**(b)** the proportion of such theoretical pension which bears the same relation to the whole as the total of the creditable periods completed under the legislation of that Party bears to the total of all the creditable periods which he or she completed under the legislation of all Parties.



The proportionate amount thus calculated shall be the rate of pension actually payable by the competent authority.

**(8)** Where a person has satisfied the conditions set out in paragraph (3), the competent authority of Jersey shall determine the actual rate of invalidity benefit payable as the amount that bears the same relation to the standard rate of benefit as the life average contribution factor bears to 1.00 over the prescribed period, except that no benefit shall be payable where the factor is less than 0.1.


**(9)** For the purposes of paragraph (3), a year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as an annual contribution factor of 1.00 under the legislation of Jersey.
