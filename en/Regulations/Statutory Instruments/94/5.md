**CHAPTER 1** 
## Totalizing


**ARTICLE VIII** 
### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Antigua and Barbuda

**1** If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 and 3, provided that the periods do not overlap.


**2** 

**(a)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda, or a period of residence in the territory of Antigua and Barbuda after the age at which periods of residence in Canada are creditable for purposes of that Act and after April 2, 1973, shall be considered as a period of residence in the territory of Canada.



**(b)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 13 weeks of contributions under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda shall be considered as a year for which contributions have been made under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).




**3** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda:

**(a)** when the calendar year 1973 is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), it shall be considered as 39 weeks for which contributions have been paid under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda;



**(b)** a calendar year commencing after April 2, 1973 which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 52 weeks of contributions under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda;



**(c)** a week commencing on or after April 2, 1973 which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a week of contributions under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda.





**ARTICLE IX** 
### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State

If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article VIII, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for totalizing periods.



**ARTICLE X** 
### Minimum Period to be Totalized

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Party is less than one year (52 weeks) and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to award benefits to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**CHAPTER 2** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE XI** 
### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of a pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.


**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person who is entitled to the payment of a pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE XII** 
### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Antigua and Barbuda


**ARTICLE XIII** 
### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable

**1** If a person is not entitled to an age pension, an invalidity pension or a survivors’ pension solely on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda, but is entitled to that benefit through the application of the totalizing of periods as provided in this Agreement, the competent institution of Antigua and Barbuda shall calculate the amount of benefit payable in the following manner:

**(a)** it shall first determine the amount of the theoretical benefit which would be payable under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda solely on the basis of the creditable periods completed under that legislation;



**(b)** it shall then multiply the theoretical benefit by the ratio that the creditable periods actually completed under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda represent in relation to the minimum creditable period required under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda for entitlement to the benefit in question.




**2** The proportional benefit calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 shall be the benefit payable by the competent institution of Antigua and Barbuda.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, where an age grant, an invalidity grant or a survivors’ grant is payable under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda, but eligibility for a corresponding pension under that legislation can be established through the application of this Agreement, the pension shall be paid in lieu of grant.


**4** Where an age grant, an invalidity grant or a survivors’ grant was paid under the legislation of Antigua and Barbuda in respect of an event which happened before the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and where eligibility for a corresponding pension under that legislation is subsequently established through the application of this Agreement, the competent institution of Antigua and Barbuda shall deduct from any benefit payable in the form of a pension, any amount previously paid in the form of a grant.
