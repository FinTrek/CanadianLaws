**PART II** 
## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**CHAPTER ONE** 
### Totalization


**ARTICLE 11** 
#### General Rules for Totalization


**1** If the legislation of a Contracting State requires the completion of insurance periods in order to establish, maintain or re-establish eligibility under a plan that is not a special plan within the meaning of Article 12, the competent institution of that Contracting State shall, to the extent necessary, and provided that the insurance periods do not overlap, consider the insurance periods completed under the legislation of the other Contracting State:

**(a)** for Canada, under the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3(a), as if those periods were completed under the applicable legislation;



**(b)** for France, under the conditions set out in paragraph 3(b), whether completed under a general or special plan, as if those periods were completed under the applicable legislation.





**2** To determine eligibility for a benefit under Canada’s [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md), any insurance period under the legislation of France or any period of residence in France beginning on or after 1 January 1966 and after the age at which periods of residence in Canada may be considered under that Act, shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.



**3** 

**(a)** To determine eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), any calendar year beginning on 1 January 1966 and including at least 78 days, 13 weeks, three months, or an insurance quarter under the legislation of France shall be considered as a year of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).



**(b)** To determine eligibility for a benefit under the legislation of France, a calendar year that is creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 312 days, 52 weeks, 12 months, or four insurance quarters under the legislation of France.





**ARTICLE 12** 
#### Special Rules for Totalization


**1** If the legislation of France governing special plans provides that a person is eligible for certain benefits on the condition that the insurance periods be completed in a specified profession or employment, then periods completed under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be taken into account in determining that person’s eligibility for those benefits only if the periods are completed in that same profession or employment.



**2** If, taking into account the totalization set out in paragraph 1, a person does not meet the eligibility requirements under the special plan, insurance periods completed under that plan shall be taken into account in accordance with the rules governing the general plan and subject to the conditions set out in the legislation of France.



**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Totalization of Insurance Periods Completed in a Third State


**1** With respect to France, insurance periods completed in a third State with which both Contracting States are bound by social security agreements that provide for the totalizing of insurance periods shall be taken into account to determine the amount of the old age or survivor’s benefit payable under this Agreement, insofar as they do not overlap with insurance periods completed in Canada. Only periods recognized for totalization under the agreement between France and the third State shall be taken into account.



**2** With respect to Canada, if insurance periods completed in the two Contracting States and totalized in accordance with Article 11 are insufficient to establish eligibility for benefits under the legislation of Canada, periods of insurance or residence completed in a third State with which both Contracting States are bound by social security agreements providing for the totalizing of insurance periods shall be taken into account, provided that they do not overlap with periods of insurance or residence completed in France. Only periods recognized for totalization under the agreement between Canada and the third State shall be taken into account.



**ARTICLE 14** 
#### Minimum Insurance Period


**1** If the total duration of insurance periods completed under the legislation of a Contracting State is less than one year, the competent institution shall not be required to apply the totalization set out in Articles 11, 12 and 13 to confer a benefit. However, if those insurance periods are sufficient to establish eligibility for a benefit under that legislation, the benefit shall then be payable based only on those periods.



**2** The periods set out in paragraph 1 may nonetheless be taken into account to establish eligibility for, and to determine the amount of a benefit under the legislation of the other Contracting State.



**CHAPITRE 2**

**2** If a person is entitled to a benefit in Canada without recourse to the provisions of this Agreement but has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) to be eligible for the benefit outside Canada, the benefit shall be paid to the person outside Canada, only if the period of insurance or residence, when totalized in accordance with Chapter One of this Part, is at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) to be entitled to the payment of a benefit outside Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

### Benefits Under the Legislation of France


**ARTICLE 18** 
#### Calculation of Old Age or Survivor’s Benefits – France


**1** If a person who is, or who has been, subject successively or alternately to the legislation of each Contracting State, meets the eligibility criteria for an old age or survivor’s benefit under the legislation of France, the competent institution shall determine the amount of the benefit, first, in accordance with the applicable legislation taking into account only the insurance periods completed under that legislation and, second, in accordance with paragraph 2, the most advantageous outcome for the person shall be applied.



**2** If a person does not meet the eligibility conditions set out under the legislation of France without the application of the totalization of insurance periods, or for the purpose of determining the most advantageous outcome in accordance with paragraph 1, the competent institution of France shall determine that person’s entitlement to the benefit as if all insurance periods completed in the other Contracting State and in one or more third States with which both Contracting States are bound by a social security agreement were completed exclusively under the legislation of France. The competent institution of France shall then reduce the amount of the benefit thus determined by a pro-rata amount based on the ratio of the length of the insurance periods completed under the applicable legislation before the date on which the contingency occurred to the total length of the insurance periods completed under the legislation of the Contracting States and one or more third States before the date on which the contingency occurred. The total length of the periods shall not exceed the maximum period that may be required under the applicable legislation for entitlement to a full benefit.



**3** If, in accordance with the legislation of France, the benefits payable are based on the salary or average income for all or a portion of the insurance period, the salary or average income taken into account for the calculation of the benefit by the competent institution or institutions of France shall only be based on the insurance period completed under the legislation applied by that institution.



**ARTICLE 19** 
#### Cases of Successive Application of Legislation


**1** If a person requests the determination of their eligibility solely under the legislation of France, without the determination of eligibility under the legislation of Canada, the amount of the benefit payable under the legislation of France shall be calculated in accordance with Article 18(1) or (2), as applicable.



**2** If entitlement to a benefit is subsequently determined under the legislation of Canada, there is not a requirement to recalculate the entitlement previously determined under the legislation of France.



**ARTICLE 20** 
#### Determination of a Disability Benefit – France


**1** 

**(a)** A disability benefit shall be determined under the legislation of France if the person is subject to that legislation at the time of the work interruption and the disability which follows.



**(b)** This determination shall be made taking into account the totalization of insurance periods in accordance with Article 11 (1), or Article 12, if totalization is required to establish eligibility for the benefit.



**(c)** In the application of the totalizing provisions, the conversion rules shall be those set out in Article 11 (3)(b), with one day being equivalent to eight hours of work.





**2** If the interruption of work and the disability which follows occurs while a person is subject to the legislation of Canada, any outstanding entitlement to a benefit under the legislation of France without recourse to the totalization of insurance periods, shall be determined solely in accordance with the legislation of France.



**3** When calculating the amount of the benefit, the competent institution of France shall apply the average annual salary that corresponds to the insurance periods completed under its legislation.



**ARTICLE 21** 
#### Determination of Eligibility to a Death Benefit – France


**1** Persons insured under the legislation of France shall be eligible for death benefits under that legislation taking into account, if applicable, periods of insurance completed in Canada.



**2** When the death occurs while a person is subject to the legislation of Canada, any outstanding entitlement to a benefit under the legislation of France shall be established solely in accordance with the legislation of France, without recourse to the totalization of insurance periods.



**ARTICLE 22** 
#### Family Benefits – France


Workers who are detached to Canada by their employer and who are subject to the legislation of France through the application of Articles 7 and 9 shall be entitled to receive, for the children who accompany them, the family benefits identified in the general Implementing Agreement referred to in Article 24.



**ARTICLE 23**
