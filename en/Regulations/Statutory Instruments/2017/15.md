## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**CHAPTER 1** 
### Totalizing


**ARTICLE 11** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Peru


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit due to insufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, that person’s eligibility shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** 

**(a)** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md), a creditable period under the legislation of Peru shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada;



**(b)** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), three months in a calendar year which are creditable under the legislation of Peru shall be considered as a calendar year that is creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** For the purposes of determining eligibility for an old age benefit under the legislation of Peru:

**(a)** A calendar year that is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months that are creditable under the legislation of Peru;



**(b)** A month that is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and that does not overlap with a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a month that is creditable under the legislation of Peru.





**4** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a disability benefit, survivor’s benefit, or funeral costs under the legislation of Peru, a calendar year that is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months that are creditable under the legislation of Peru.



**5** All creditable periods under the legislation of Peru, including those creditable periods completed prior to the date on which the contributor reaches the age of 18, shall be taken into account to determine an applicant’s eligibility to a benefit under the legislation of Canada. However, a benefit shall not be paid unless the deceased or disabled person’s contributory period is at least equivalent to the minimum qualifying period required under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) to establish eligibility to that benefit for that person.



**ARTICLE 12** 
#### Periods under the Regime of a Third State


If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 11, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and periods completed under the regime of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments that provide for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Minimum Period to be Totalized


If the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, the right to a benefit does not exist under the legislation of that Party, that Party shall not be required to pay a benefit in respect of those periods. The other Party shall, however, take these creditable periods into consideration to determine whether a person is eligible for the benefit under the legislation of that other Party through the application of Chapter 1.



**CHAPTER 2** 
### Benefits under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 14** 
#### Benefits under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md)


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or allowance under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) based solely on the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in accordance with the provisions of that Act governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, based solely on the periods of residence in Canada that may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Canada shall pay an Old Age Security pension to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized in accordance with Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**ARTICLE 15** 
#### Benefits under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)


If a person is eligible for a benefit based solely on the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** The amount of the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), based solely on the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** The amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be pro-rated by multiplying:

the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in accordance with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



the fraction representing the ratio of the periods of contribution to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit. That fraction shall not exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
### Benefits under the Legislation of Peru


**ARTICLE 16** 
#### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable


**1** If the conditions for eligibility for a benefit are met under the legislation of Peru without the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of Canada, Peru shall determine the amount of that benefit based solely on the creditable periods accumulated under its legislation.



**2** If eligibility for a benefit under the legislation of Peru can be established only through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, Peru shall:

**(a)** calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be paid if the totalized creditable periods had been accumulated under the legislation of Peru alone; and



**(b)** on the basis of the theoretical amount of the benefit calculated in accordance with subparagraph (a), determine the amount of benefit payable by applying the ratio of the length of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of Peru to the totalized creditable periods.

**ARTICLE 19** 
### Exemption or Reduction of Dues, Fees or Charges

The date of submission of applications, notices and appeals to the competent authority or liaison agency of the other Party shall be deemed to be the date of their submission to the competent authority or liaison agency of the first Party.

The preceding sentence shall not apply to an application submitted before the date of entry into force of this Convention or if the applicant requests that the payment of the benefit under the legislation of the other Party be delayed.

## Applicable Legislation


**ARTICLE 3** 
### Issuing a Certificate of Detachment


**1** In the cases set out in Articles 6 to 9 of the Convention, the Party whose legislation applies shall, on request, issue a certificate of fixed duration certifying that, in respect of the work in question, the employed person and that person’s employer or the self-employed person are subject to that legislation. That Party shall send a copy of the certificate to the employed person, that person’s employer, or the self-employed person, and the liaison agency or competent institution of the other Party.



**2** The consent referred to in Article 7 of the Convention should be requested before the end of the current term of the detachment. If the request for the extension is received after the certificate of detachment expires, the Party that receives the request shall examine the reasons for the delay and, if it determines that the delay is justifiable, shall send the request to the liaison agency or the competent institution of the other Party to obtain consent.

### Processing an Application


**1** A Party that receives an application for a benefit under the legislation of the other Party shall promptly send the application to the liaison agency or competent institution of the other Party, and indicate the date of receipt of the application.



**2** Along with the application, a Party shall transmit any documentation available to it that may be necessary for the liaison agency or competent institution of the other Party to establish the applicant’s eligibility for a benefit.

**3** A Party shall certify the personal information contained in the application, and shall confirm that the information is corroborated by documentary evidence. Once a Party transmits the certified forms to the liaison agency or competent institution of the other Party, it shall be exempt from sending the documentary evidence. The Parties shall mutually decide on the type of information to which this exemption applies.



**4** A Party shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide free of charge, to the liaison agency or competent institution of the other Party, available medical examination reports, information and documentation concerning the disability of an applicant or beneficiary.

**6** A Party shall determine the applicant’s eligibility and shall notify the liaison agency or competent institution of the other Party of its decision to grant or deny the benefit and the reason for its denial.
