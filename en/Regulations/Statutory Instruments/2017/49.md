**PART III** 
## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**CHAPTER I** 
### Totalizing


**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Italy


**1** If a person is not entitled to a benefit because he or she has not completed sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, entitlement to that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** 

**(a)** For purposes of determining entitlement to a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Italy or a period of residence in Italy, after the age at which periods of residence in Canada are creditable for purposes of that Act, shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.



**(b)** For purposes of determining entitlement to a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 13 weeks which are creditable under the legislation of Italy shall be considered as a year for which contributions have been made under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** For purposes of determining entitlement to a benefit under the legislation of Italy,

**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 52 weeks of contributions under the legislation of Italy; and



**(b)** a week which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a week of contributions under the legislation of Italy.





**ARTICLE 14** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State


If a person is not entitled to a benefit on the basis of the periods creditable under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 13, entitlement to that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and periods creditable under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by separate social security instruments which provide for totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 15** 
#### Minimum Period to Be Totalized


Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 13 and 14, if the total duration of the creditable periods completed under the legislation of a Party is less than one year (52 weeks) and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to award benefits in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement. These periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent institution of the other Party to determine entitlement to benefits under the legislation of that Party through the application of this Chapter.



**ARTICLE 16** 
#### Entitlement to Italian Voluntary Insurance


For purposes of determining entitlement to the continuation, on a voluntary basis, of Italian insurance, periods creditable under the legislation of Canada shall, to the extent necessary, be totalized with the periods creditable under the legislation of Italy, provided that they do not overlap.



**CHAPTER II** 
### Benefits under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 17** 
#### Benefits under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md)


**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of a pension or spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I of this Part III, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence which may be considered under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).



**2** If a person is entitled to the payment of a pension in Canada without recourse to the provisions of this Agreement, but has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to payment of a pension outside Canada, the pension payable in Canada shall be paid outside Canada if the creditable periods, when totalized as provided in Chapter I of this Part III, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,

**(a)** the competent institution of Canada shall not be liable to pay an Old Age Security pension to a person who is outside Canada unless that person’s creditable periods, when totalized as provided in Chapter I of this Part III, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** the spouse’s allowance and the guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 18** 
#### Benefits under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)


If a person is entitled to a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I of this Part III, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of such benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER III** 
### Benefits under the Legislation of Italy


**ARTICLE 19** 
#### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable


**1** If a person meets the requirements of the legislation of Italy for entitlement to benefits without recourse to the totalizing provisions of Chapter I of this Part III, the competent institution of Italy shall pay the amount of the benefit calculated solely on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation which it is applying; the preceding shall apply even if the person is entitled, under the legislation of Canada, to a benefit on the basis of the totalizing of periods, as provided in Chapter I of this Part III.



**2** If a person is not entitled to a benefit under the legislation of Italy solely on the basis of the creditable periods under that legislation, the competent institution of Italy shall determine whether entitlement to that benefit can be established through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter I of this Part III. The amount of the benefit shall be calculated as follows:

**(a)** by determining the theoretical amount of the benefit to which the person would be entitled if all the totalized periods had been completed under the legislation of Italy;



**(b)** by determining the actual amount of the benefit to which the person is entitled by reducing the theoretical amount calculated as provided in subparagraph (a) on the basis of the ratio of the creditable periods under the legislation which it is applying to the total of the periods completed under the legislation of both Parties;



**(c)** for purposes of determining the amount of a benefit within the meaning of this paragraph, the competent institution of Italy shall use the average earnings or income which is subject to contributions under the legislation of Italy even in respect of the creditable periods under the legislation of Canada;



**(d)** if the total length of the creditable periods under the legislation of both Parties exceeds the maximum period specified by the legislation of Italy for entitlement to a full benefit, the competent institution of Italy shall consider this maximum period instead of the total length of the periods in question.





**3** If the legislation of Italy makes entitlement to certain benefits subject to periods of contributions having been completed in an occupation covered under a special scheme, only the periods creditable under the legislation of Canada completed in the same occupation shall be taken into account. If, after totalizing such periods, the person does not meet the entitlement conditions for those benefits, such periods shall be used for purposes of establishing entitlement to benefits under the general compulsory scheme.



**4** If entitlement to a benefit is established through the application of Article 14, creditable periods under the legislation of third States shall be taken into account for purposes of calculating the theoretical amount and the ratio of periods referred to in subparagraphs 2(a) and (b) of this Article.



**5** If a person who resides in Italy is entitled to benefits under the legislation of both Parties, and if the combined amount of those benefits does not total the minimum pension amount (*trattamento minimo di pensione*) prescribed under the legislation of Italy, the competent institution of Italy shall grant, in addition to the benefits it pays, a supplement necessary to arrive at that minimum pension amount.



**ARTICLE 20** 
#### Italian Family Benefits


**1** Subject to paragraph 2, a person who receives an Italian old age, disability or survivors pension shall also be paid family benefits for members of his or her family who reside in Canada, provided that the conditions prescribed in Italian legislation are met.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall not apply in regard to a member of the family of a person who resides in Canada if a Canadian child benefit, other than one under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), is payable for that family member.



**ARTICLE 21** 
#### Cash Benefits for Tuberculosis


When a person does not meet the requirements of the legislation of Italy for entitlement to cash benefits for tuberculosis solely on the basis of the periods of contributions credited under the legislation of Italy, periods creditable under the legislation of Canada shall, to the extent necessary, be taken into account to establish such entitlement. These cash benefits shall also be payable to a beneficiary who resides in Canada.
