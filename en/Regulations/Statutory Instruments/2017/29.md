### **Schedule** 
## Statement Setting Out the Reasons for Referring the Assessment of the Spring Salamander (*Gyrinophilus Porphyriticus*) Carolinian Population Back to COSEWIC
The Carolinian population of the Spring Salamander, a large lungless salamander, was historically recorded in the Niagara Regional Municipality in southern Ontario. When COSEWIC assessed the Spring Salamander (*Gyrinophilus porphyriticus*) Carolinian population in 2011, it assigned a status of extirpated to this species because no valid records of it had been documented for more than 50 years. However, since the publication of the assessment, new and emerging information regarding that population has become available that COSEWIC would like to consider in the assessment of the species. Therefore the assessment of this species is referred back to COSEWIC for consideration.
