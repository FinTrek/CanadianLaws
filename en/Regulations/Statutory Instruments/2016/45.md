In such a case, the provisions of Article VII shall apply.

**5** Where a company is a resident of a Contracting State, the other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.”





**(c)** Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article XI (Interest) shall be deleted and replaced by:**“4** The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the recipient of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises a trade or business through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article VII shall apply.

In such a case, the provisions of Article VII shall apply.

**6** Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and those royalties are borne by that permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.”





**(e)** Paragraph 2 of Article XIII (Gains from the Alienation of Property) shall be deleted and replaced by:**“2** Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or together with the whole enterprise) may be taxed in the other State. However, gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic and movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which such property is taxable according to paragraph 3 of Article XXII.”

In such a case, the income derived from those activities may only be taxed in the other Contracting State.”





**ARTICLE 10** 


Article XXIII (Elimination of Double Taxation) of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following Article:

**“ARTICLE XXIII** 
### *Elimination of Double Taxation*
**1** In Spain, double taxation shall be avoided following either the provisions of its internal legislation or the following provisions in accordance with the internal legislation of Spain:

**(a)** Where a resident of Spain derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Canada, Spain shall allow:

**(i)** as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Canada;



**(ii)** the deduction of the underlying corporation tax shall be given in accordance with the internal legislation of Spain.



Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Canada.



The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to any income tax paid in Canada in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article XIII.





**(b)** Where in accordance with any provision of this Convention income derived by a resident of Spain is exempt from tax in Spain, Spain may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income.



**2** In Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

**(a)** subject to the existing provisions of the laws of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in Spain on profits, income or gains arising in Spain shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains;



**(b)** subject to the existing provisions of the laws of Canada regarding the allowance as a credit against Canadian tax of tax payable in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof where a company which is a resident of Spain pays a dividend to a company which is a resident of Canada and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the first-mentioned company, the credit shall take into account the tax payable in Spain by that first-mentioned company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid; and



**(c)** where, in accordance with any provision of this Convention, income derived by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income, take into account the exempted income.



**3** For the purpose of paragraph 2, profits, income or gains of a resident of Canada that may be taxed in Spain in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Spain.”





**ARTICLE 11** 


Article XXV (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following Article:

**“ARTICLE XXV** 
### *Mutual Agreement Procedure*
**1** Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, address to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident an application in writing stating the grounds for claiming the revision of such taxation. To be admissible, the said application must be submitted within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.

**2** The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

**3** A Contracting State shall not, after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after eight years from the end of the taxable period to which the income concerned was attributed, increase the tax base of a resident of either of the Contracting States by including therein items of income that have also been included in income in the other Contracting State. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or when a Contracting State applies anti-abuse rules.

**4** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention.

**5** The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention and may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying this Convention.”





**ARTICLE 12** 


Article XXVI (Exchange of Information) of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following Article:

**“ARTICLE XXVI** 
### *Exchange of Information*
**1** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is forseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles I and II.

**2** Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.

**3** In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

**(a)** to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(b)** to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(c)** to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).



**4** If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

**5** In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because the information relates to ownership interests in a person.”





**ARTICLE 13** 


The following new Article XXVI-A (Assistance in the Collection of Taxes) shall be inserted into the Convention after Article XXVI:

**“ARTICLE XXVI-A** 
### *Assistance in the Collection of Taxes*
**1** The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles I and II. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article, including agreement to ensure comparable levels of assistance.

**2** The term ***revenue claim*** as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description collected by or on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs related to such amount.

**3** When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. Where an application for collection of a revenue claim is accepted:

**(a)** by Spain, the revenue claim shall be collected by Spain in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collections of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of Spain; and



**(b)** by Canada, the revenue claim shall be treated by Canada as an amount payable under the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md), the collection of which is not subject to any restriction.



**4** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. A revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be recovered by imprisonment of the debtor in the other Contracting State.

**5** Nothing in this Article shall be construed as creating or providing any rights of administrative or judicial review of a revenue claim of a Contracting State in the other State.

**6** Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the revenue claim ceases to be a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.

**7** In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

**(a)** to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(b)** to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public);



**(c)** to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection, available under its laws or administrative practice;



**(d)** to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State.”







**ARTICLE 14** 


Article XXVIII (Miscellaneous Rules) of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following Article:

**“Article XXVIII** 
### *Miscellaneous Rules*
**1** The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State.

**2** Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of Canada with respect to a company or other entity in which that resident has an interest.

**3** This Convention shall not apply to any company or other entity that is a resident of a Contracting State and is beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons who are not residents of that State, if the amount of the tax imposed on the income or capital of the company or other entity by that State is substantially lower than the amount that would be imposed by that State (after taking into account any reduction or offset of the amount of tax in any manner, including a refund, reimbursement, contribution, credit, or allowance to the company or to any other person) if all of the shares of the capital stock of the company or all of the interests in the entity, as the case may be, were beneficially owned by one or more individuals who were residents of that State.

**4** For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 4 of Article XXV or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.”





**ARTICLE 15**
