### **FORM 4** 
**(Rule 11.03 and subrules 12.02(1) and 12.03(1))**
## Pre-trial Conference Brief

###### **NOTE:**

**1** This Form must be filed by the assigned prosecutor and by counsel for each accused person or, if self-represented, the accused, before the first pre-trial conference or the resolution conference, whichever occurs earlier, unless otherwise ordered.


**2** Each party must provide their position on each issue and not indicate they “will advise” or “not as yet”, etc.


**3** The prosecutor must file this Form and serve it on defence counsel or, if self-represented, the accused, at least 14 days before the pre-trial conference or resolution conference. Counsel or the self-represented accused must file and serve their brief on the prosecutor at least seven days before the pre-trial conference or the resolution conference, regardless of whether the Crown has filed the Form. In cases where the Crown has not filed the Form or has filed it late, defence counsel or the self-represented accused should complete the Form to the extent possible.


**4** If any party changes the position taken on this Form, they must provide written notice to the other party and to the pre-trial judge of the change in position. If a party has not indicated that an application or motion will be brought, the presumption is that it will not be heard. The failure to notify the other side and the Court of any application not indicated on this Form will be a factor considered by the trial judge in determining whether the new position has prejudiced the other party and whether the application may proceed.


**5** The prosecutor’s copy of the brief must be accompanied by a brief synopsis of the allegations and the theory of the Crown’s case. If the prosecutor is arguing that the accused is liable to an offence as a party, the section of the Code that is being relied on by the prosecutor must be indicated.
