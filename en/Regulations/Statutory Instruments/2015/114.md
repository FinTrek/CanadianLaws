They must ensure that silence is maintained and that the people present at a hearing are suitably seated. They assist the judge in the application of this Regulation and the guidelines concerning the use of technology in the courtroom.





**22** **Dress code.** Every person present in the courtroom must be suitably dressed.Except in civil practice, judges wear a black robe either closed in front or with a black jacket, a white shirt, collar and bands, dark clothing and appropriate footwear at all times in the courtroom.

Except in civil practice, lawyers wear a black robe closed in front with a black jacket, a white shirt, collar and bands, dark clothing and appropriate footwear at all times in the courtroom.

Male lawyers and notaries, in cases where the wearing of a robe is not required, wear trousers, a jacket, shirt and tie in plain taste and appropriate footwear, and female lawyers and notaries wear a skirt or trousers with a blouse and jacket or a plain dress with appropriate footwear.

The same rules apply to articling students, minus the bands.

In proceedings for the recovery of a small claim, article 557 of the Code of Civil Procedure (chapter C-25.01) applies.When a party foresees that it will not be able to proceed on the date set by the court or requests the cancellation of a subpoena or summons, it must immediately notify the opposing party and the coordinating judge, associate coordinating judge or a judge designated by one of the former and present an application for that purpose.

Except with permission from one of the above judges, any application for the postponement of a case set for trial must be presented in writing, with reasons, ten days before the date set for the trial.

Prior notice of the application of three working days, excepting Saturdays, must be given to all the parties.

Notwithstanding the time limit provided for in the third paragraph, if the reasons for the postponement are known less than 10 days before the date set for the trial, the coordinating judge, the associate coordinating judge or a judge designated by one of the former may receive a written application for postponement and make a decision, ensuring that the best interests of justice are served.

When the postponement is granted, the reasons for the decision are entered in the record.







**29** **Opening and adjournment of the hearing.** The persons present at a hearing must rise when the judge enters the room and remain standing until the judge is seated.At the opening of the hearing, the court bailiff or clerk says aloud, as the case may be, “Silence. Please rise. The Court of Québec, presided over by the Honourable Judge ____________ is now in session” or “Silence. Please rise. The Court of Québec, presided over by the presiding justice of the peace ____________ is now in session”.

Once the judge is seated, the court bailiff or clerk asks those present to be seated.

When the judge leaves, the court bailiff or clerk asks those present to rise, and no person may leave his or her seat until the judge has left the room.

The stenographer is required to record the whole trial, including the addresses, except if exempted by the judge.





**35** **Testimony outside court.** Any testimony given outside court is recorded in a way that allows it to be stored and reproduced.When a stenographer’s services are used, the stenographer may, in the event of a failure to observe decorum or good order, suspend the taking of testimony in order to obtain from the judge, as soon as possible, a decision on whether to continue.

Stenographic notes may be filed in “four in one” format, with an alphabetical index.





**36** **Transcript or copy of sound recording.** When a transcript of the evidence is required by the judge, the clerk must provide it within 30 days unless the judge decides otherwise.When a judge renders judgment at the hearing, any request for a transcript or a copy of the sound recording must be sent to the judge in order to review its accuracy.

Unless otherwise provided for or otherwise ordered by the judge, every person may obtain from the clerk, on payment of the fees, a copy of the sound recording of a trial.

In youth protection and adoption cases, except if an appeal has been filed, the sound recording of the trial and the stenographic notes cannot be copied or transcribed without authorization from the court, which sets the conditions for access and disclosure.
