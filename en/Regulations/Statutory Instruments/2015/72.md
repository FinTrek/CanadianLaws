**ARTICLE 12** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of India and Canada**


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Contracting State, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** For purposes of determining eligibility for an old age benefit under the legislation of India:

**ARTICLE 13** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of a Third State**


If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Contracting States, totalized as provided in Article 12, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods completed under the legislation of a third State with which both Contracting States are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Contracting State is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under the legislation of that Contracting State, the competent institution of that Contracting State shall not be required to pay a benefit to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement. These creditable periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent institution of the other Contracting State to determine eligibility for the benefits of that Contracting State through the application of Chapter 1.



**Chapter 2**
### **Benefits under the Legislation of Canada**


**ARTICLE 15** 
#### **Benefits under the Old Age Security Act**


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or allowance under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of that Act governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**ARTICLE 16** 
#### **Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan**


If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**Chapter 3**
### **Benefits under the Legislation of India**


**ARTICLE 17** 
#### **Calculating the Amount of Benefits Payable**


**1** If a person is entitled to a benefit under the legislation of India without taking into account the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Canada, the competent institution of India shall determine the amount of the benefit payable on the basis of the creditable periods completed under its legislation.



**2** The competent institution of India shall also calculate the amount of old age, survivors’ or disability benefit by applying the rules specified in subparagraphs 3(a) and (b).



**3** If a person is entitled to a benefit solely through the application of the totalization provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of India:

**(a)** shall calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be paid if the totalized creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of both Contracting States had been accumulated under the legislation of India alone; and



**(b)** on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with subparagraph (a), shall determine the amount of the benefit payable by applying the ratio of the duration of the creditable periods completed under the legislation of India to the total aggregate of creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of both Contracting States.
