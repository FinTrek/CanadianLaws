### **ANNEX** 
## Statement Setting Out the Reasons for Referring the Assessment of the Shortfin Mako (*Isurus oxyrinchus*) Atlantic Population Back to COSEWIC
The Shortfin Mako Atlantic population was assessed by COSEWIC as a species of special concern under the [Species at Risk Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2002/c.%2029.md) in April 2017. The Shortfin Mako is a low-productivity species compared with other shark species, and has an estimated generation time of approximately 25 years. A recent assessment, in autumn 2017, by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas presents new information and analysis that strongly indicate that the status of the Shortfin Mako in Canada is considerably less positive than COSEWIC’s assessment. COSEWIC has advised that, due to the new information that was not available at the time of the initial assessment of the status of the Shortfin Mako Atlantic population, this status now needs to be reassessed. In light of the need for consideration of this new information, the assessment of this species is referred back to COSEWIC for further consideration.
