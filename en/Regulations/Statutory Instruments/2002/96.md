- **(6)** The Registrar shall send a copy of all written reasons for judgment, the reasons explaining oral judgment or the memorandum of disposition, as the case may be, without charge to the parties or their counsel, to the court appealed from, and to any libraries and other persons as the Chief Justice authorizes in the particular case or generally.
