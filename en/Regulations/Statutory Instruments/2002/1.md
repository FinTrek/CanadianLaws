**PART III** 
## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**CHAPTER 1** 
## Totalization


**ARTICLE 9** 
### Totalizing Creditable Periods

**1** When the legislation of a Contracting Party makes the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to a benefit subject to the completion of prescribed creditable periods and a person has not completed sufficient creditable periods under that legislation to fulfill those conditions, the competent organization of that Contracting Party shall determine the eligibility of that person for that benefit by totalizing those creditable periods and creditable periods under the legislation of the other Contracting Party, as specified in this Part, provided that those periods do not overlap.


**2** If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Contracting Parties, totalized as provided in paragraph 1, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing those periods and creditable periods under the legislation of a third State with which both Contracting Parties are bound by social security arrangements or agreements which provide for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 10** 
### Creditable Periods of Less Than One Year

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Contracting Party is less than one year and if no right to a benefit exists under the legislation of that Contracting Party, the competent organization of that Contracting Party shall not be required to pay a benefit to that person in respect of those periods. Those periods shall, however, be taken into account, if necessary, by the competent organization of the other Contracting Party in determining eligibility for a benefit under its legislation.



**CHAPTER 2** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 11** 
### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**1** For purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, a creditable period under the legislation of Uruguay shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.


**2** If a person is eligible for an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent organization of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.


**3** Paragraph 2 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**4** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 12** 
### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan

**1** For purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, a calendar year including at least 3 months or 13 weeks of contributions under the legislation of Uruguay shall be considered as a year of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).


**2** If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent organization of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determine in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Uruguay


**SECTION 1** 
## System of Individual Funding


**ARTICLE 13** 
### Application of the Legislation of Uruguay

**1** Workers who are affiliated with an Administrator of Insurance Savings Funds (Administradora de Fundos de Ahorro Previsional) shall finance their benefits in Uruguay with the balance accumulated in their individually funded account.


**2** Benefits granted under the funded scheme shall be added to benefits which are payable under the pay-as-you-go scheme if the worker meets the conditions prescribed in the legislation in force. If necessary, the totalizing of creditable periods shall be applied.



**SECTION 2** 
## Pay-as-you-go System


**ARTICLE 14** 
### Determining Eligibility and the Payment of Benefits

A worker who has been successively or alternately subject to the legislation of both Contracting Parties shall be eligible for the benefits included in this Chapter according to the following rules:


**1** The competent organization of Uruguay shall determine eligibility for and calculate the amount of a benefit by taking into account only the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Uruguay.


**2** In the same way, the competent organization of Uruguay shall determine eligibility for a benefit by totalizing its own creditable periods and the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Canada. When totalizing results in eligibility for a benefit, the amount payable shall be calculated in accordance with the following rules.

**(a)** The competent organization shall determine the amount of the benefit to which the person concerned would be entitled if all of the totalized creditable periods had been completed under its legislation (theoretical pension).



**(b)** The competent organization shall determine the amount of benefit payable by applying to the theoretical pension, calculated according to its legislation, the same proportion as that between the creditable period completed under the legislation of Uruguay and the total creditable periods completed under the legislation of both Contracting Parties (pro-rata pension).




**3** Once eligibility has been established in accordance with the preceding paragraphs, the competent organization shall determine and pay the benefit which is most favourable to the person concerned, without taking into account the decision taken by the competent organization of Canada.



**ARTICLE 15** 
### Specific Conditions for Determining Eligibility

**1** If the legislation makes the granting of benefits specified in this Chapter conditional on the fact that the worker is subject to that legislation at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the benefit, that condition shall be deemed to be met if, at that time, the worker is subject to the legislation of Canada or, if this is not the case, is receiving a benefit under the legislation of Canada of the same type or of a different type but to which the beneficiary is entitled on his or her own account.


The same principle shall apply for the granting of survivors pensions for which, if necessary, account is taken of the deceased person’s status under the legislation of Canada as a beneficiary or pensioner.


**2** If the legislation requires that, in order to grant a benefit, periods of contributions must have been completed in a prescribed time immediately before the occurrence of the event giving rise to the benefit, that condition shall be deemed to be met if the person concerned has completed creditable periods under the legislation of Canada in the time immediately before the granting of the benefit.


**3** The provisions of the legislation in respect of a beneficiary who is employed shall also apply if that employment is carried out in the territory of Canada.



**ARTICLE 16** 
### Periods of Contributions Under Special or Enhanced Schemes

**1** If the legislation makes eligibility for, or the granting of, certain benefits subject to the completion of creditable periods in a profession subject to a special or enhance scheme, or in a particular type of profession or employment, creditable periods completed under the legislation of Canada shall be taken into account for the granting of those benefits only if they were completed in the same type of profession or, as the case may be, in an occupation with similar characteristics.


**2** If, taking into account the periods thus completed, the person concerned does not fulfill the conditions for entitlement to a benefit from a special or enhanced scheme, those periods shall be taken into account for the granting of benefits under the general scheme, or under any other special or enhanced scheme in which that person may have acquired rights.



**CHAPTER 4** 
## Other Provisions


**ARTICLE 17** 
### Determining Eligibility for a Death Benefit

**1** For the purposes of this Article, ***legislation of Canada*** means the legislation specified in Article 2(1)(a)(ii).


**2** If a person has completed creditable periods under the legislation of both Contracting Parties, eligibility for a death benefit in respect of that person shall be determined according to the following rules:

**(a)** If a death benefit is payable in respect of that person under the legislation of Canada, without recourse to the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent organization of Canada shall pay that death benefit, and the competent organization of Uruguay shall not pay a death benefit.



**(b)** If the conditions of sub-paragraph (a) do not apply, the competent organizations of both Contracting Parties shall determine eligibility for death benefits under their respective legislation, applying, if required, the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1. If, as a result, eligibility is established only under the legislation of one Contracting Party, the competent organization of that Contracting Party shall pay a death benefit.



However, if, as a result of applying the first sentence of this sub-paragraph, eligibility is established under the legislation of both Contracting Parties, only the competent organization of the Contracting Party under whose legislation the person concerned last paid contributions shall pay a death benefit in respect of that person, and the competent organization of the other Contracting Party shall not pay a death benefit





**ARTICLE 18** 
### Adjusting Benefits

Benefits payable as a result of applying the provisions of this Part shall be adjusted with the same frequency and in the same amount as benefits payable under domestic legislation. However, as regards benefits whose amounts have been determined under the pro-rata formula given in Article 14, the amount of the adjustment may be determined by applying the same rule of proportionality which was applied to determine the amount of the benefit.



**PART IV** 
## Miscellaneous, Transitional and Final Provisions


**CHAPTER 1** 
## Miscellaneous Provisions


**ARTICLE 19** 
### Submission of Documents

**1** Claims, notices, appeals, and other documents which, for the purposes of applying the legislation of a Contracting Party, should have been presented within a prescribed period to the competent authorities or competent organizations of that Contracting Party shall be deemed to have been presented to them if they were presented within the same period to the corresponding competent authority or organization of the other Contracting Party. The date of presentation of the claim, notice, appeal or other document to the competent authority or organization of the other Contracting Party shall be deemed to be the date of its presentation to the competent authority organization of the first Contracting Party.


**2** Subject to the second part of this paragraph, any claim for a benefit submitted under the legislation of a Contracting Party after the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a claim for the corresponding benefit under the legislation of the other Contracting Party, provided that the person concerned specifically states in writing at the time of making the claim, or it can be determined from the documentation submitted, that he or she has completed creditable periods under the legislation of the other Contracting Party.


The preceding shall not apply if the applicant requests that his or her claim to the benefit under the legislation of the other Contracting Party be delayed.

The cost incurred for such examinations shall be borne by the competent organization of the Contracting Party making the request.
