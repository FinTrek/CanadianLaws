**(ii)** if the total duration of those periods of residence is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that Act, the agency of Canada shall not be required to pay a benefit in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.





**(2) (a)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md), a quarter of coverage credited under United States laws on or after January 1, 1952 and after the age at which periods of residence in Canada are credited for purposes of that Act shall be considered as three months of residence in the territory of Canada.

**(b)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least one quarter of coverage credited under United States laws shall be considered as a year of coverage credited under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).
