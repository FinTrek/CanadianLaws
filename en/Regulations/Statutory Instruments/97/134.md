## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**CHAPTER 1**
## Totalizing


**ARTICLE IX** 


#### **Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Greece**

**1** If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and, to the extent necessary, periods completed under the legislation of the other Party, as specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.


**2** (a) For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Greece or a period of residence in Greece, after the age at which periods of residence in Canada are creditable for purposes of that Act, shall be considered as a period of residence in the territory of Canada.


**(b)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 75 days which are creditable periods under the legislation of Greece shall be considered as a year which is creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).


**3** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the legislation of Greece:


**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 300 days which are creditable under the legislation of Greece; and

**ARTICLE X** 


#### **Periods under the Legislation of a Third State**

If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article IX, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE XI** 


#### **Minimum Period to be Totalized**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to award benefits to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**CHAPTER 2**
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE XII** 


#### **Benefits under the Old Age Security Act**

**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of a pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.


**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person who is entitled to the payment of a pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:


**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and


**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).



**ARTICLE XIII** 


#### **Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan**

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:


**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and


**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:


**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)


by


**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.



**CHAPTER 3**
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Greece


**ARTICLE XIV** 


#### **Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable**

**1** If a person is entitled to a Greek benefit without regard to the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the amount of the benefit shall be calculated according to the Greek legislation on the basis of the creditable periods completed under that legislation.


**2** If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the benefit due under Greek legislation shall be determined as follows:


**(a)** The Greek competent institution shall first calculate the amount of the benefit which would have been awarded to the person concerned (theoretical amount) if the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Canada and totalized according to the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1 to establish eligibility for old-age, invalidity and survivors benefits had been completed under its own legislation.


**(b)** For the calculation of the amount of the benefit, the competent institution shall take into account the salary (earnings), income or contributions paid during creditable periods completed under Greek legislation.


**(c)** If the amount, as determined above, is less than the minimum benefit provided under Greek legislation, the minimum benefit amount shall be taken into account.


**(d)** If the benefit amount is not dependent on the length of the creditable periods, this amount shall be considered to be the theoretical amount.


**(e)** Based on the amount calculated according to the preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph, the competent institution shall calculate the partial benefit payable by it according to the ratio between the length of the creditable periods completed under its own legislation and the total duration of the creditable periods which have been taken into account.


**3** For the determination of the kind of benefit and the competent institution, only Greek creditable periods shall be taken into account.


**4** If the award of certain benefits under Greek legislation depends on the condition that creditable periods be completed in a profession covered by a special scheme, creditable periods completed under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in the same profession or the same employment shall be taken into account for the award of these benefits. If, taking into account the periods thus completed, the person concerned does not meet the required conditions, these periods shall be taken into account for the award of benefits under the general system.



**PART IV**
