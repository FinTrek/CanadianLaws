**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and

If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit solely on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Republic of the Philippines, but is entitled to the payment of that benefit through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of the Republic of the Philippines shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** it shall first determine the amount of the theoretical benefit which would be payable under the legislation of the Republic of the Philippines solely on the basis of the minimum creditable periods required under that legislation;
