**4** If a person who is ordinarily resident in Canada reaches the age of entitlement to New Zealand superannuation or a veteran’s pension, that person shall not be entitled to receive, or shall no longer be entitled to receive, as the case may be, an invalids benefit, widows benefit or domestic purposes benefit paid to a widower.



**5** For the purposes of this Agreement, a person who has not reached the age of entitlement for New Zealand superannuation shall not be deemed to be entitled or qualified to receive New Zealand superannuation or a veteran’s pension.



**ARTICLE VI**

**1** In determining whether a person meets the residential qualifications for a benefit specified in the legislation of New Zealand, the institution of New Zealand shall:



**(a)** in the case of New Zealand superannuation or a veteran’s pension, deem a Canadian creditable period accumulated by that person after attaining the age of 20 years to be a period during which that person was both resident and present in New Zealand; and



**(b)** in the case of an invalids benefit, a widows benefit or a domestic purposes benefit paid to a widower, deem a Canadian creditable period accumulated by that person under the *Canada Pension Plan* to be a period during which that person was both resident and present in New Zealand.



**2** For the purposes of paragraph 1:



**(a)** if a period of residence in New Zealand and a Canadian creditable period coincide, the period of coincidence shall be taken into account only once as a period of residence in New Zealand;



**(b)** a Canadian creditable period accumulated under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) which coincides with a Canadian creditable period accumulated under the *Canada Pension Plan* shall be taken into account only once.



**3** In determining whether a person who is ordinarily resident in New Zealand or Canada is entitled to receive a widows benefit or a domestic purposes benefit paid to a widower, a dependent child of that person born in Canada shall be treated as though that child was born in New Zealand provided that:



**(a)** in the case of a widow, the child was conceived before the death of the person’s last deceased spouse; and



**(b)** in the case of a widower, the child was born before the death of the person’s last deceased spouse.



**4** In determining whether a widow who is ordinarily resident in New Zealand or Canada is entitled to receive a widows benefit:

**(b)** any period during which that widow and her last deceased spouse both accumulated Canadian creditable periods under the *Canada Pension Plan* shall be taken into account once only; and



**(c)** a Canadian creditable period accumulated under the Canada Pension Plan by that widow’s last deceased spouse shall be deemed to be a period during which that spouse was ordinarily resident in New Zealand for the purposes of determining the ordinary residence of that spouse.

**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:



**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the *Canada Pension Plan*



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the *Canada Pension Plan* in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.
