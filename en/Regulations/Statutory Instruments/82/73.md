**(b)** If a person is entitled to an old age benefit under the Old Age Security Act without recourse to the following provisions of this Article, this benefit shall be payable in the territory of Greece if that person has accumulated, in all, at least 20 years of residence in Canada.



**(c)** If a person is entitled to an old age benefit under the rules set out in subsections 3(1)(a) and (b) of the Old Age Security Act, without recourse to the following provisions of this Article, but has not accumulated 20 years of residence in Canada, a partial benefit shall be payable to him in the territory of Greece if the periods of residence in the territory of the two Parties when totalized according to the rules set out in paragraph 4 of this Article, represent at least 20 years. The amount of old age benefit payable in the territory of Greece shall, in this case, be calculated in accordance with the principles governing the payment of the partial pension payable, according to paragraphs 3(1.1) to 3(1.4) inclusive of the Old Age Security Act and the details of application of the paragraphs of that Act to this Agreement shall be defined by the Administrative Arrangement provided for in Article XIV.



**(d)** If a person is entitled to a partial pension according to the rules in paragraphs 3(1.1) to 3(1.4) inclusive of the Old Age Security Act, without recourse to the following provisions of this Article, the partial pension shall be payable in the territory of Greece if the periods of residence in the territory of the two Parties when totalized according to the rules set out in paragraph 4 of this Article equal at least 20 years.





**2** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the applicable legislation for the purposes of the following paragraphs of this Article is, respectively, the legislation of Greece listed in Article II which provides for old age benefits, and, for Canada, the Old Age Security Act, with the exception of paragraph 3(1) of that Act.



**3** If a person is not entitled to an old age benefit on the basis of the periods credited under the legislation of one of the Parties, entitlement to that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those stipulated in the following paragraph of this Article, provided that these periods do not overlap.



**4** 

**(a)** For purposes of establishing entitlement to an old age benefit payable by Canada under paragraph 5 of this Article, residence in the territory of Greece after the age specified and determined in the Administrative Arrangement shall be counted as residence in the territory of Canada;



**(b)** For purposes of establishing entitlement to an old age benefit payable by Greece under paragraph 5 of this Article,

**(i)** a month ending on or before December 31, 1965 which would be recognized as a month of residence under the Old Age Security Act shall be treated as a month of contributions under the legislation of Greece,



**(ii)** a year in which a contribution has been made to the Canada Pension Plan and commencing on or after January 1, 1966 shall be accepted as twelve months of contributions under the legislation of Greece,



**(iii)** a month commencing on or after January 1, 1966 which would be a month of residence for the purposes of the Old Age Security Act and in relation to which no contribution has been made under the Canada Pension Plan shall be accepted as a month of contribution under the legislation of Greece provided, however, that the interested person has contributed to the Canada Pension Plan for a period of at least equal duration. For the application of this provision, one year of contributions is considered to be equal to twelve months,



**(iv)** for any month of residence under the Old Age Security Act, Greece will count twenty-five days of insurance and for any year of contributions to the Canada Pension Plan, Greece will count three hundred days of insurance.

**(a)** as regards Canada, in conformity with the legislation which it administers, directly and exclusively on the basis of the periods accomplished under its legislation;



**(b)** as regards Greece, the competent institution shall first determine the amount of the benefit by taking into consideration, to the extent necessary, periods credited under the legislation of Canada as if they had been completed under the Greek insurance schemes, excluding overlapping periods. The average salary or the average income taken into consideration for the calculation of the benefit shall be determined strictly on the basis of income or salaries earned during periods of participation in the Greek insurance schemes. On the basis of the pension amount thus calculated (adjusted, as the case may be, to the amount of the guaranteed minimum pension) the Greek institution shall determine the benefit owing by multiplying that amount by the ratio that the number of periods of Greek insurance represents in relation to the total number of periods taken into account.





**6** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, where the total of credited periods is not equal to at least ten years, Canada will not be liable to pay any old age benefit under this Article, and when this period is not equal to at least 20 years, Canada will not be liable to pay any old age benefit by virtue of this Article, in the territory of Greece.



**CHAPTER 2  SPOUSE'S ALLOWANCE** 
### ARTICLE IX


**1** The legislation of Canada applicable in respect of the Spouse's Allowance under this Article shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, be the Old Age Security Act excepting subsection 17.1(1) of that Act.



**2** If a person is not entitled to the Spouse's Allowance because he has not satisfied the residence requirements of the Old Age Security Act but he has resided in the territories of the Parties for a total of at least 10 years after the age specified and determined in the Administrative Arrangement, Canada shall pay to that person a partial Spouse's Allowance, calculated as prescribed by the Old Age Security Act.



**3** Except for subsection 17.1(6) of the Old Age Security Act, the Spouse's Allowance is payable only in the territory of Canada.



**CHAPTER 3  SURVIVOR'S BENEFIT, INVALIDITY BENEFIT, CHILDREN'S BENEFIT AND DEATH BENEFIT**

**3** If a person is not entitled to a benefit solely on the basis of the periods credited under the legislation of one of the Parties, entitlement to the benefit shall be determined by totalizing the credited periods in accordance with the provisions of the succeeding paragraphs of this Article. For the purposes of survivor's benefits, children's benefits and death benefits only, any reference in this Article to a credited period shall be construed as applying to the person by virtue of whose contributions a benefit is being claimed.



**4** 

**(a)** For the purposes of establishing entitlement to a benefit payable by Canada under paragraph 5 of this Article, a year including at least 75 days of insurance under the legislation of Greece shall be accepted as a year for which contributions have been made under the Canada Pension Plan;



**(b)** The provisions of Article VIII 4(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) shall apply for the purpose of establishing entitlement to any benefit payable by Greece under paragraph 5 of this Article.





**5** 

**(a)** The provisions of Article VIII (5) shall apply to this Article except, in relation to Canada, for calculation of the amount of the flat rate benefit payable under the Canada Pension Plan;



**(b)** The amount of the flat rate benefit under the Canada Pension Plan is the amount obtained by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat rate benefit determined under the provisions of the Canada Pension Plan, by



**(ii)** the ratio that the periods of contributions to the Canada Pension Plan represent in relation to the total of the periods of contributions to the Canada Pension Plan and of only those periods credited under the legislation of Greece required to satisfy the minimum requirements for entitlement under the Canada Pension Plan.







**6** Any period of contribution under the legislation of Greece prior to the date upon which the contributor reached the age of 18 may be taken into consideration for determining an applicant's entitlement to a survivor's, orphan's, death or invalidity benefit under the legislation of Canada. However, no survivor's, orphan's, death or disability benefit may be paid unless the deceased contributor's or disabled person's contributory period under the Canada Pension Plan corresponds to at least the minimum qualifying period required by the legislation of Canada.



**CHAPTER 4  COMMON PROVISIONS** 
### ARTICLE XI


**1** In the event of totalization for a benefit under the provisions of Articles VIII, IX and X, if the total duration of the periods completed under the legislation of one Party is not one year, the competent institution or the competent authority of that Party shall not be required to award benefits in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**2** These periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the institution or authority of the other Party to establish entitlement to the benefits of that Party through totalization.



**3** For the purpose of this Article "periods completed under the legislation of one Party" means for Canada, in addition to credited periods, any period of residence mentioned in paragraph 4(a) of Article VIII.



**CHAPTER 5  LUMP SUM BENEFIT ON RETIREMENT**
