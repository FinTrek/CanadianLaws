## Provisions Concerning Benefits

**ARTICLE 11** 
#### Periods Under the Legislation of Canada and the Republic of Poland


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** For the purpose of determining eligibility:

**(a)** for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of the Republic of Poland shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada;



**(b)** for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 3 months which are creditable periods under the legislation of the Republic of Poland shall be considered as a year which is creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** For the purpose of determining eligibility for an old age pension under the legislation of the Republic of Poland:

**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months which are creditable under the legislation of the Republic of Poland;



**(b)** a month which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a month which is creditable under the legislation of the Republic of Poland.





**4** For the purpose of determining eligibility for a benefit other than an old age pension under the legislation of the Republic of Poland, a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months which are creditable under the legislation of the Republic of Poland.



**ARTICLE 12** 
#### Periods Under the Legislation of a Third State


If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 11, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods completed under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Minimum Period To Be Totalized


**1** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under the legislation of that Party, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to pay a benefit to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**2** Notwithstanding paragraph 1, these creditable periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent institution of the other Party to determine eligibility for a benefit of that Party through the application of Chapter 1.



**CHAPTER 2** 
### Benefits Payable Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 14** 
#### Benefits Under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md)


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or allowance under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of that Act governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside the territory of Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in the territory of Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside the territory of Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside the territory of Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside the territory of Canada;



**(b)** an allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside the territory of Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 15**

If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.

**1** If entitlement to an old age, disability or survivor’s pension exists under the legislation of the Republic of Poland, the old age, disability or survivor’s pension shall be calculated exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the legislation of the Republic of Poland, unless the amount of the old age, disability or survivor’s pension calculated in the manner described in paragraph 2 is more favourable.



**2** If entitlement to an old age, disability or survivor’s pension is established solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of the Republic of Poland:

**(b)** on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), shall determine the actual amount of the benefit by applying the ratio of the length of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of the Republic of Poland to the total creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of the Republic of Poland and under the legislation of Canada.





**3** For purposes of calculating the base amount of the benefit, only earnings under the legislation of the Republic of Poland and contributions paid under that legislation shall be taken into account.



**4** Where the legislation of the Republic of Poland requires for entitlement to an old age, disability or survivor’s pension that a person be insured at the time of the contingency, this requirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled for the purpose of establishing entitlement if the person:

**(a)** has at least one year of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) during a period of two calendar years ending with the calendar year in which the contingency occurs; or



**(b)** is in receipt of a disability or a retirement pension under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in the calendar month in which the contingency occurs.





**ARTICLE 17** 
#### Entitlement to Benefits for Work Accidents and Occupational Diseases

**2** Where the legislation of the Republic of Poland requires that the occupational disease be first diagnosed in the territory of the Republic of Poland, this requirement shall also be fulfilled if the disease is first diagnosed in the territory of Canada.



**3** If a person’s occupational disease reoccurs or worsens while that person is residing in the territory of Canada and subject to the legislation of Canada, the competent institution of the Republic of Poland will readjust the amount of the benefit in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Poland, provided the type of work performed in the territory of Canada did not contribute to the worsening or reoccurrence of the disease.
