### **ANNEX** 
## Statement Setting Out the Reasons for Referring the Assessment of the Yukon Draba (*Draba yukonensis*) Back to COSEWIC
Yukon Draba is a small herbaceous mustard plant. At the time of COSEWIC’s assessment in 2011, the only occurrence known worldwide was in a single meadow complex in southwestern Yukon. The meadow complex is under threat from industrial activities, nearby human habitation, invasive species, trampling by humans and forest encroachment. Given the rarity of suitable habitat within the range of natural dispersal, the restricted range and extreme population fluctuations as understood at the time of the assessment, COSEWIC proposed that the Yukon Draba be designated as endangered. However, since the publication of the assessment, COSEWIC has advised that a reassessment is warranted based on new information regarding the species range in Canada and its population dynamics.
