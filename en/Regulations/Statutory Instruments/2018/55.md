TO ALL TO WHOM these presents shall come or whom the same may in any way concern,

GREETING:



## A Proclamation


Whereas the Constitution of Canada recognizes and affirms the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada;

Whereas the Aboriginal peoples of Canada have made and continue to make valuable contributions to Canadian society and it is considered appropriate that there be, in each year, a day to mark and celebrate these contributions and to recognize the different cultures of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada;

Whereas June 21 of each year was declared to be “National Aboriginal Day” by proclamation issued on June 13, 1996 and registered on July 10, 1996;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to advancing reconciliation with the First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada through renewed nation-to-nation, Inuit-Crown and government-to-government relationships based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership;

Whereas the expression “Indigenous peoples” refers to the First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada;

Whereas it is therefore desired to rename “National Aboriginal Day” as “National Indigenous Peoples Day”;

And whereas, by Order in Council P.C. 2018-792 of June 20, 2018, the Governor in Council directed that a proclamation be issued renaming “National Aboriginal Day” held on June 21 of each year as “National Indigenous Peoples Day”;

Now know you that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our proclamation rename “National Aboriginal Day” held on June 21 of each year as “National Indigenous Peoples Day”.

Of all which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these presents may concern are required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.

In testimony whereof, We have caused this Our Proclamation to be published and the Great Seal of Canada to be affixed to it.

WITNESS:

Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved Julie Payette, Chancellor and Principal Companion of Our Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Military Merit, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Merit of the Police Forces, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.



AT OUR GOVERNMENT HOUSE, in Our City of Ottawa, this twenty-eighth day of June in the year of Our Lord two thousand and eighteen and in the sixty-seventh year of Our Reign.

BY COMMAND,


<p>Navdeep Singh Bains<br />Registrar General of Canada<br /></p>
