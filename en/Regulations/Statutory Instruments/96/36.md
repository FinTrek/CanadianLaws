A Proclamation

Whereas the maple leaf is recognized nationally and internationally as representing Canada and Canadians, as a symbol of our natural heritage and national identity;

And Whereas the maple tree has played a meaningful role in the historical development of Canada, first as discovered and utilized by the First Nations, later contributing to the lifestyles and economy of the European settlers, and more recently for its commercial, environmental and aesthetic importance to all Canadians;

And Whereas the maple tree is an important and environmentally sustainable source of economic activity;

And Whereas the maple tree (genus *acer*) has ten species native to Canada;

Now Know You that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, do by this Our Proclamation designate the maple tree (genus *acer*) as national arboreal emblem of Canada.

Of All Which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.

In Testimony Whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent and the Great Seal of Canada to be hereunto affixed. Witness: Our Right Trusty and Well-beloved Roméo A. LeBlanc, a Member of Our Privy Council for Canada, Chancellor and Principal Companion of Our Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of Our Order of Military Merit, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
