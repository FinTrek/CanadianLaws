## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**CHAPTER 1** 
## Totalizing


**ARTICLE 12** 
### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Mexico

**1** If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit because he or she has not completed sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.


**2** 

**(a)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Mexico shall be considered as a period of residence in the territory of Canada.

**3** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit for old age or mandatory retirement under the legislation of Mexico:

**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as fifty-two weeks which are creditable under the legislation of Mexico; and



**(b)** a week which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a week which is creditable under the legislation of Mexico.

**ARTICLE 13** 
### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State

If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 12, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security agreements which provide for totalizing periods.



**ARTICLE 14** 
### Creditable Periods of Less Than One Year

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the creditable periods completed by a person under the legislation of a Party total less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to award a benefit to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**CHAPTER 2** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 15** 
### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of a pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.


**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person who is entitled to the payment of a pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 16** 
### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**CHAPTER 3** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Mexico


**ARTICLE 17** 
### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable

A worker who has been successively or alternately subject to the legislation of both Parties shall be entitled to benefits included in this Agreement according to the following terms:


**1** If the worker meets the requirements of the legislation of Mexico for entitlement to a benefit, the competent institution of Mexico shall take into account only the creditable periods completed under that legislation.


**2** If the worker does not meet the requirements of the legislation of Mexico for entitlement to a benefit, the competent institution of Mexico shall totalize creditable periods under that legislation and creditable periods as provided in Chapter 1. When totalization results in entitlement to a benefit, the amount payable shall be calculated as follows:

**(a)** The competent institution of Mexico shall determine the amount of the benefit to which the person concerned would be entitled if all the totalized creditable periods had been completed under its own legislation (theoretical benefit).



**(b)** The amount of the benefit that Mexico shall be required to pay shall be determined by applying, to the theoretical benefit calculated according to its legislation, the same proportion as that between the creditable periods completed under the legislation of Mexico and the total creditable periods as provided in Chapter 1 (pro-rated benefit).



**(c)** If the resulting amount of the benefit is less than the legal minimum pension, the person concerned can opt to receive, in place of the benefit, a lump-sum payment equal to the benefit that would be payable over a period of five years.





**ARTICLE 18** 
### Conditions for the Maintenance of Rights

**1** When the acquisition of the right to a benefit under the legislation of Mexico is conditional on being subject to that legislation at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the benefit, that condition shall be deemed to be met if, at that time, the person concerned is subject to the legislation of Canada or, if this is not the case, is receiving a benefit under the legislation of Canada of the same type or of a different type but based on creditable periods completed by that person. The same principle shall apply to the granting of death and survivors benefits for which, if necessary, account is taken of the status of the deceased person as being insured or the recipient of a benefit at the time of death.


**2** When, for the acquisition of the right to a benefit under the legislation of Mexico, a person must have completed a creditable period in a prescribed period immediately before the occurrence of the event giving rise to the benefit, that condition shall be deemed to be met if the competent institution of Canada certifies that the person concerned has completed  a  creditable  period  under  the  legislation  of Canada during that same period.



**PART IV** 
## Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions


**ARTICLE 19**

### Exemption or Reduction of Taxes or Charges

**1** Any exemption from or reduction of taxes, legal dues, consular fees or administrative charges for which provision is made in the legislation of a Party in connection with the issuing of any certificate or document required to be produced for the application of that legislation shall be extended to certificates or documents required to be produced for the application of the legislation of the other Party.

**2** Subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, a claim for benefit under the legislation of a Party made after the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a claim for the corresponding benefit under the legislation of the other Party, provided that the applicant:
