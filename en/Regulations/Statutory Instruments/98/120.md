### **Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines**

**(a)** it shall first establish the rate of the pension which would be payable if the person qualified for the pension on the basis of creditable periods completed under the legislation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines alone;



**(b)** it shall then multiply that rate by the fraction which represents the ratio of the actual creditable periods under the legislation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in relation to the minimum creditable period required to establish entitlement to that pension under that legislation.





**2** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, where a grant is payable under the legislation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, but entitlement to a pension under that legislation can be established through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the pension shall be paid in lieu of the grant.



**3** Where a grant was paid under the legislation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in respect of an event which happened before the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and where entitlement to a pension under that legislation is subsequently established through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines may deduct from any pension payable any amount previously paid in the form of a grant.
