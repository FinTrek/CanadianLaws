**CHAPTER 1**
## Totalizing


**ARTICLE XII** 


#### **Periods under the Legislation of Canada and the Republic of Chile**

**1** If a person is not entitled to a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the entitlement of that person to that benefit shall be determined by totalizing creditable periods under the legislation of both Parties, as specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.


**2** (a) For purposes of determining entitlement to a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of the Republic of Chile shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.


**(b)** For purposes of determining entitlement to a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 3 months or 13 weeks of contributions under the legislation of the Republic of Chile shall be considered as a year of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).


**3** For purposes of determining entitlement to an old age benefit under the legislation of the Republic of Chile:


**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months or 52 weeks which are creditable under the legislation of the Republic of Chile; and


**(b)** a month or week which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a month or week which is creditable under the legislation of the Republic of Chile.


**4** For purposes of determining entitlement to a disability or survivors benefit under the legislation of the Republic of Chile, a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months or 52 weeks which are creditable under the legislation of the Republic of Chile.



**ARTICLE XIII** 


#### **Minimum Period to be Totalized**

If the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to award benefits to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**CHAPTER 2**
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE XIV** 


#### **Benefits under the Old Age Security Act**

**1** If a person is entitled to an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.


**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be entitled to a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:


**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and


**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).



**ARTICLE XV** 


#### **Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan**

If a person is entitled to a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:


**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and


**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:


**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)


by


**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.



**CHAPTER 3**
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Chile


**ARTICLE XVI** 


#### **Determining Benefits**

**1** Persons who are affiliated with a Pensions Funds Administrator (Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones) shall finance their pensions in Chile with the balance accumulated in their individual capitalization account. If this is insufficient to provide pensions in an amount at least equal to the minimum pension guaranteed by the State, affiliated persons shall be entitled to totalize creditable periods in accordance with Chapter 1 in order to qualify for the minimum old age or disability pension benefit. Beneficiaries of a survivors pension shall also have this right.


**2** For purposes of determining the fulfilment of the requirements specified in the Chilean legal provisions for an early retirement pension under the New System of Pensions, affiliated persons who have obtained a pension under the legislation of Canada shall be considered as pensioners under the social insurance plans administered by the Institute for Social Insurance Standardization.


**3** Workers who have been affiliated with the New System of Pensions in Chile shall be allowed to make voluntary social insurance contributions to that System as self-employed persons during the time they reside in Canada, subject, nonetheless, to compliance with the legislation of the latter country regarding the obligation to contribute. Workers who opt to exercise this right shall be exempt from the obligation to make the contribution intended for the financing of health benefits.


**4** Contributors to the pension plans administered by the Institute for Social Insurance Standardization shall also be entitled to totalize periods in accordance with Chapter 1 in order to qualify for the pension benefits for which provision is made in the legislation applicable to them.


**5** For the purpose of qualifying for pensions under the legislation that governs the social insurance plans administered by the Institute for Social Insurance Standardization, persons who are receiving pensions under the legislation of Canada shall be considered as current contributors to the social insurance plan that applies to them.


**6** In the situations described in paragraphs 1 and 4 above, the competent institution shall determine the amount of the benefit as if all the creditable periods had been completed under its own legislation; for the purposes of the payment of the benefit, it shall calculate the part for which it is liable on the basis of the ratio between the creditable periods completed exclusively in Chile and the total creditable periods completed in both Parties.


When the sum of the creditable periods in both Parties exceeds the period specified in the legislation of Chile for entitlement to a full pension, the excess periods shall be disregarded for the purposes of this calculation.



**ARTICLE XVII** 


#### **Health Benefits for Pensioners**

Persons who receive a pension under the legislation of Canada and who reside in Chile shall be entitled to enrol themselves in the health benefit plans of Chile under the same conditions as the pensioners of the latter country.



**CHAPTER 4**
## Determining Disability


**ARTICLE XVIII** 


#### **Medical Examinations**

**1** In determining disability, the competent institution of each Party shall carry out the evaluations required under the legislation that it applies. If a competent institution of a Party requests the competent institution of the other Party to conduct a medical examination of an applicant or beneficiary who resides in the territory of the latter Party, such examination shall be arranged or carried out by an institution of the latter Party.


**2** The cost resulting from a medical examination, whether it is performed by a specialist or a general practitioner, which is in the exclusive interest of the institution which has requested the examination shall be borne by that institution.


**3** If the competent institution of Chile bears the cost of such examinations, it can directly charge the person concerned for the reimbursement of 50% of the cost of those examinations. The portion of the cost that the worker assumes shall be deducted by the competent institution of Chile from any pensions that are granted, or, if there are no such pensions, from the balance in the individual capitalization account of workers affiliated with the New System of Pensions.


**4** When new examinations are requested for purposes of an appeal against a disability ruling made by Chile, the costs of these examinations shall be paid in the manner specified in the preceding paragraph, unless the appeal has been lodged by a competent institution of Chile or by an insurance company, in which case such expenses shall be borne by the appellant.


**5** The conditions under which the provisions of the preceding paragraphs will be applied shall be set out in an administrative arrangement concluded pursuant to Article XIX.



**PART IV**
## Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions

**2** A claim for benefit under the legislation of a Party made after the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a claim for the corresponding benefit under the legislation of the other Party, provided that the applicant, at the time of application, indicates that he or she has completed creditable periods under the legislation of the other Party. The preceding sentence, however, shall not apply if the applicant expressly requests that the submission of his or her claim for a benefit under the legislation of the other Party be delayed.
