## Article 5


### Permanent Establishment

**1** For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.


**2** The term “permanent establishment” includes especially:

**(a)** a place of management;



**(b)** a branch;



**(c)** an office;



**(d)** a factory;



**(e)** a workshop; and



**(f)** a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources.




**3** A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts for more than twelve months.


**4** Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:

**(a)** the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;



**(b)** the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;



**(c)** the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;



**(d)** the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise;



**(e)** the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;



**(f)** the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e) provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.




**5** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person — other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies — is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.


**6** An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.


**7** The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.



## Article 6


### Income from Immovable Property

**1** Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.


**2** For the purposes of this Convention, the term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.


**3** The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.


**4** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.



## Article 7


### Business Profits

**1** The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.


**2** Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.


**3** In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed those deductible expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.


**4** Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.


**5** No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.


**6** For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.


**7** Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then, the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.



## Article 8


### Shipping and Air Transport

**1** Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.


**2** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.


**3** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits referred to in those paragraphs derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from its participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.


**4** In this Article,

**(a)** the term “profits” includes interest on sums generated directly from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic provided that such interest is incidental to the operation;



**(b)** the term “operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic” by a person, includes:

**(i)** the charter or rental of ships or aircraft, and



**(ii)** the rental of containers and related equipment,



by that person provided that such charter or rental is incidental to the operation by that person of ships or aircraft in international traffic.







## Article 9


### Associated Enterprises

**1** Where

**(a)** an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or



**(b)** the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,



and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any income which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, has not so accrued, may be included in the income of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.




**2** Where a Contracting State includes in the income of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - income on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the income so included is income which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State, if the conditions made between the enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together with a view to reach an agreement on the adjustments of income in both Contracting States.


**3** A Contracting State shall not change the income of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic law and, in any case, after five years from the end of the year in which the income which would be subject to such change would have accrued to that enterprise. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default.



## Article 10


### Dividends

**1** Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.


**2** However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:

**(a)** 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that owns at least 10 per cent of the voting stock and of the capital of the company paying the dividends;



**(b)** notwithstanding subparagraph (a), 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the dividends are paid by a non-resident owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada to a beneficial owner that is a resident of Switzerland and that holds at least 10 per cent of the voting stock and of the capital of the corporation paying the dividends; and



**(c)** 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.




The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid.


**3** The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.


**4** The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.


**5** Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.


**6** Notwithstanding any provision in this Convention, Canada may impose on the earnings of a company attributable to permanent establishments in Canada, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company incorporated in Canada, provided that the rate of such additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the profits attributable to such permanent establishments in Canada (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 13, of such permanent establishments) in accordance with Article 7 in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom:

**(a)** business losses attributable to such permanent establishments (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such permanent establishments) in such year and previous years;



**(b)** all taxes chargeable in Canada on such profits, other than the additional tax referred to herein;



**(c)** the profits reinvested in Canada, provided that the amount of such deduction shall be determined in accordance with the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the computation of the allowance in respect of investment in property in Canada, and any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof; and



**(d)** five hundred thousand Canadian dollars ($500,000) less any amount deducted:

**(i)** by the company, or



**(ii)** by a person related thereto from the same or a similar business as that carried on by the company,



under this sub-paragraph (d); for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (d), a company is related to another company if one company directly or indirectly controls the other, or both companies are directly controlled by the same person or persons, or if the two companies deal with each other not at arm’s length.



The provisions of this paragraph shall also apply with respect to earnings from the alienation of immovable property in Canada by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property without a permanent establishment in Canada but only insofar as these earnings may be taxed in Canada in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 or paragraph 1 of Article 13.






**7** The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2(c) and 4 shall also apply to income derived by a resident of Switzerland from an estate or a trust which is a resident of Canada. For the purposes of paragraph 2(b) of Article 22, the term “dividend” shall include such income.



## Article 11


### Interest

**1** Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.


**2** However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.


**3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State to the extent that such interest:

**(a)** is a penalty charge for late payment; or



**(b)** is paid with respect to indebtedness resulting from the sale on credit by a resident of the other Contracting State of any equipment, merchandise or services, except where the sale is made between associated enterprises within the meaning of Article 9, paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) or where the payer and the recipient of the interest are associated enterprises within the meaning of the same paragraphs.




**4** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2,

**(a)** interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State if it is paid in respect of indebtedness of the government of the first-mentioned State or of a political subdivision or local authority thereof;



**(b)** interest arising in Switzerland and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation or by any institution specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States;



**(c)** interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of Switzerland shall be taxable only in Switzerland if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured under the Swiss provisions regulating the “garantie contre les risques à l’exportation” or by any institution specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; and



**(d)** interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State which was constituted and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension, retirement or other employee benefits plans shall not be taxable in the first-mentioned State provided that:

**(i)** the resident is the beneficial owner of the interest and is generally exempt from tax in the other State; and



**(ii)** the interest is not derived from carrying on a trade or a business or from a related person.






**5** The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 8 or in Article 10.


**6** The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.


**7** Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.


**8** Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.



## Article 12


### Royalties

**1** Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.


**2** However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.


**3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2,

**(a)** copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or other artistic work (but not including royalties in respect of motion picture films nor royalties in respect of works on film or videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television broadcasting);



**(b)** royalties for the use of, or the right to use, computer software; and



**(c)** where the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties are not related persons, royalties for the use of, or the right to use, any patent or any information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience (but not including any such information provided in connection with a rental or franchise agreement),



arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State.




**4** The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process or other intangible property, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, and includes payments of any kind in respect of motion picture films and works on film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television.


**5** The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.


**6** Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.


**7** Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

**6** Gains from the alienation of any property, other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident.


**7** The provisions of paragraph 6 shall not affect the right of Canada to levy, according to its law, a tax on gains derived by an individual who is a resident of Switzerland from the alienation of any property, if the alienator:

**(a)** possesses Canadian nationality or was a resident of Canada for fifteen years or more prior to the alienation of the property, and

**(a)** Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions — which shall not affect the general principle hereof — and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in Switzerland on profits, income or gains arising in Switzerland shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains.



**(b)** Where a resident of Switzerland derives a gain, referred to in paragraph 7 of Article 13, which may be taxed in Canada, Canada shall, subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions — which shall not affect the general principle hereof — allow as a deduction from any Canadian tax payable by that person in respect of such gain, an amount equal to the tax paid in Switzerland on that gain.

**2** In the case of Switzerland, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

**(a)** Where a resident of Switzerland derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Canada, Switzerland shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (b), (c) and (d), exempt such income or capital from tax but may, in calculating tax on the remaining income or capital of that resident, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if the exempted income or capital had not been so exempted; provided, however, that such exemption shall apply to gains referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 13 only if actual taxation of such gains in Canada is demonstrated.



**(b)** Where a resident of Switzerland derives dividends, interest or royalties which, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12, may be taxed in Canada, Switzerland shall allow, upon request, a relief to such resident. The relief may consist of:

**(i)** a deduction from the Swiss tax on the income of that resident of an amount equal to the tax levied in Canada in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12; such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Swiss tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the income which may be taxed in Canada; or



**(ii)** a lump sum reduction of the Swiss tax; or



**(iii)** a partial exemption of such dividends, interest or royalties from Swiss tax, in any case consisting at least of the deduction of the tax levied in Canada from the gross amount of the dividends, interest or royalties.



Switzerland shall determine the applicable relief and regulate the procedure in accordance with the Swiss provisions relating to the carrying out of international conventions of the Swiss Confederation for the avoidance of double taxation.

## Article 23


### Non-Discrimination

**2** The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.
