**(a)** Persons specified in subparagraphs (a) to (c) of Article 3 of the Agreement who, prior to the date on which the National Socialist sphere of influence extended to what was then their homeland,

**-** belonged to the German language and cultural group,



**-** had already attained age 16, and



**-** had not acknowledged themselves to be ethnically German because they were Jewish,



and who left the areas of expulsion within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 2, number 3, of the GermanFederal Law on Displaced Persons, may, upon application, pay retroactive voluntary contributions to the German pensions insurance system, provided that periods of contributions or periods of employment under the Foreign Pensions Law become creditable for these persons for the first time as a result of Article 17A of the Foreign Pensions Law. The retroactive voluntary contributions may only be paid for periods after attainment of age 16 and before attainment of age 65 and starting with the time the National Socialist sphere of influence was extended to what was then their homeland. Contributions shall only be permitted for periods that have not already been credited as periods of contributions according to German laws. An event giving rise to eligibility for benefits which occurs prior to the expiration of the time limit for the payment of retroactive contributions shall not preclude the payment of these retroactive contributions.





**(b)** Retroactive voluntary contributions according to subparagraph (a) may not exceed the amount necessary to permit payment of benefits based on periods creditable under Article 17A of the Foreign Pensions Law in accordance with the statutory pension provisions on payment of benefits to eligible persons abroad that were applicable in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany - without the Acceding Territory (Beitrittsgebiet) - on 1 July 1990.



**(c)** Notwithstanding the second sentence of subparagraph (a), persons who attained age 65 on or before 31 October 1991, and who, on 1 July 1990, do not meet the requirements for payment of benefits abroad through retroactive voluntary contributions pursuant to this Agreement, may pay voluntary contributions for the period from 1 July 1990, to 30 November 1991, but in an amount no greater than that which is necessary for the payment of the benefit abroad; for this purpose, the date of eligibility may be deferred to a point in time after attainment of age 65.



**(d)** Contributions shall be paid in an amount of 43.19 Euro (84.48 Deutsche Mark) for each calendar month; for this purpose, the amount of retroactive voluntary contributions to be paid may be set off against the amount of any resulting benefits that are payable retroactively. For the computation of the insured person’s relevant German pension computation base, the values for the year 1994 shall be applied to the retroactively paid contributions.



**(e)** For purposes of computing the benefit amount, the statutory pension provisions applicable within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany — without the Acceding Territory — on 1 July 1990, including the provisions on benefit payments to eligible persons abroad, shall be applied, together with this Agreement. The provisions on revaluation of pensions based on Personal Remuneration Points (Article 307 of Volume VI of the Social Law Code) shall be applied accordingly. The monthly amount of the benefit that is to be paid abroad shall be derived from the Pension Category Factor, as well as

**(i)** the Personal Remuneration Points for contribution periods under Article 17A of the Foreign Pensions Law that are to be considered in accordance with the first sentence of this subparagraph (e); provided, however, that these shall be multiplied by the Present Pension Value (East) - but not more than 0.7 times the Present Pension Value - and a Pension Value of 8.16 Euro (15.96 Deutsche Mark) shall apply for the period from 1 July 1990, to 31 December 1990, a Pension Value of 9.39 Euro (18.36 Deutsche Mark) shall apply for the period from 1 January 1991, to 30 June 1991, and a Pension Value of 10.79 Euro (21.11 Deutsche Mark) shall apply for the period from 1 July 1991, to 31 December 1991;



**(ii)** the Personal Remuneration Points for contribution periods to be considered according to subparagraphs (b) and (c) multiplied by the Present Pension Value that is applicable in the year for which the pension is to be paid, with the amount of 23.52 Euro (46.00 Deutsche Mark) being used for periods prior to 1 July 1995; and



**(iii)** the remaining Personal Remuneration Points multiplied by the Present Pension Value that is applicable in the year for which the pension is to be paid, with the amount of 20.24 Euro (39.58 Deutsche Mark) being used for periods prior to 1 July 1991.





**(f)** Subparagraphs (a) through (e) shall only apply with respect to eligible persons who established ordinary residence in Canada before 1 July 1990.



**(g)** For purposes of payment of survivors benefits, subparagraphs (a) through (f) shall apply accordingly to survivors of persons described in subparagraph (a), even if the insured person dies prior to the expiration of the time limit for retroactive voluntary contributions. This shall also apply in the case of benefits for former spouses with pension rights and in the case of reinstated survivors pensions.



**(h)** An application to pay retroactive voluntary contributions according to this point must be filed within 24 calendar months following the entry into force of this point. The application must be filed with the social insurance institution to which the last German contribution was paid or deemed to have been paid, and which is competent for adjudicating the benefit claim. If the last German contribution was paid to an institution of the miners pensions insurance system, retroactive voluntary contributions may only be paid to the wage earners or salaried employees insurance system. The contributions shall be paid to the social insurance institution that is competent to accept and process the application.



**(i)** Applications under subparagraph (h) shall be considered timely filed applications for benefits. Benefits resulting from this point shall be paid beginning 1 July 1990, if the event giving rise to eligibility occurs prior to this date and the benefit eligibility requirements applicable on 1 July 1990, are met. If the event giving rise to eligibility occurs after 30 June 1990, benefits resulting from this point shall be paid beginning with the calendar month following the month in which the event giving rise to eligibility occurs and the benefit eligibility requirements applicable on 1 July 1990, are met; a survivors benefit shall be paid from the date of death if a benefit was not payable to the insured person for the month of death.



**(j)** Subparagraphs (h) and (i) shall also apply with respect to persons whose pensions were awarded prior to the entry into force of this point. In this case, the amount of Personal Remuneration Points shall at least equal the amount previously considered.”







**(17)** Point 14 of the Final Protocol to the Agreement is deleted.



**ARTICLE 2** 


**(1)** This Supplementary Agreement shall be subject to ratification. The instruments of ratification shall be exchanged in Berlin as soon as possible.
