## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**Chapter 1**
### **Totalizing**


**ARTICLE 11** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of Canada and the Czech Republic**


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** 

**(a)** For purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the Old Age Security Act of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of the Czech Republic shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.



**(b)** For purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year including at least 90 days which are creditable periods under the legislation of the Czech Republic shall be considered as a year which is creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** For purposes of determining eligibility for an old age benefit under the legislation of the Czech Republic:

**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a creditable period under the legislation of the Czech Republic;



**(b)** a period which is creditable under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which is not part of a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a creditable period under the legislation of the Czech Republic.

**ARTICLE 12** 
#### **Periods under the Legislation of a Third State**


If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 11, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.



**ARTICLE 13** 
#### **Minimum Period to be Totalized**


Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated by a person under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under the legislation of that Party, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to pay a benefit to that person in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement.



**Chapter 2**
### **Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada**


**ARTICLE 14** 
#### **Benefits under the Old Age Security Act**


**1** If a person is eligible for an Old Age Security pension or an allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.



**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada;



**(b)** an allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 15** 
#### **Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan**


If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**Chapter 3**
### **Benefits Under the Legislation of the Czech Republic**


**ARTICLE 16** 
#### **Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable**


**1** If, under the legislation of the Czech Republic, the conditions for eligibility for a benefit are met without the need to take into account creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of Canada, the competent institution of the Czech Republic shall determine the amount of that benefit exclusively on the basis of the creditable periods accumulated under its legislation.



**2** If, under the legislation of the Czech Republic, eligibility for a benefit can be established only through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of the Czech Republic:

**(a)** shall calculate the theoretical amount of the benefit which would be paid if the totalized creditable periods had been accumulated under the legislation of the Czech Republic alone; and



**(b)** on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), shall determine the amount of benefit payable by applying the ratio of the length of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of the Czech Republic to the totalized creditable periods.





**3** For purposes of determining the assessment base used in calculating the amount of a benefit, creditable periods under the legislation of Canada shall be excluded.



**4** A supplement due to infirmity which is payable to a person whose eligibility for a pension has been determined through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1 shall be calculated in accordance with the formula specified in paragraph (2)(b).



**ARTICLE 17** 
#### **Restrictions**


**1** The provisions of the legislation of the Czech Republic concerning the reduction, suspension or cancellation of benefits when these overlap with other benefits or when the beneficiary derives other income or pursues gainful employment shall also be applied to a person who receives a benefit under the legislation of Canada or who derives other income or pursues gainful employment outside the Czech Republic. The preceding sentence, however, shall not apply in instances involving overlapping of benefits of the same kind for invalidity, old age and survivorship which have been granted by the competent institutions of both Parties.



**2** The competent authority of the Czech Republic may, in regard to a recipient of a benefit under its legislation, limit the application of the legislative provisions mentioned in paragraph 1 concerning the reduction, suspension or cancellation of benefits which overlap with other benefits, or it may entirely waive the application of those provisions. The application of those provisions shall be waived in all cases in which the application of the provisions would result in a lower entitlement to benefit than would occur through the application of the provisions of the legislation of the Czech Republic concerning overlapping benefits in regard to a State with which the Czech Republic has not concluded an international agreement on social security.



**3** A person whose invalidity began before he or she reached age 18 and who has not participated in the insurance scheme of the Czech Republic for the necessary period shall acquire the right to a full invalidity pension only if that person is a permanent resident of the Czech Republic.
