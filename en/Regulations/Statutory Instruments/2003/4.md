**1** Where a person to whom this Agreement applies has claimed an Australian benefit under this Agreement and has accumulated:

**(a)** a period as an Australian resident that is less than the period required to qualify that person, on that ground, for a benefit under the legislation of Australia; and



**(b)** a period of Australian working life residence equal to or greater than the period identified in accordance with paragraph 6 for that person,



and has accumulated a Canadian creditable period, then for the purposes of a claim for that Australian benefit, that Canadian creditable period shall be deemed, only for the purposes of meeting any minimum qualifying periods for that benefit set out in the legislation of Australia, to be a period in which that person was an Australian resident.





**2** In the case of a claim by a person for a disability support pension or pension payable to a widowed person, paragraph 1 shall apply only to a Canadian creditable period accumulated by that person under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).



**3** For the purposes of a claim by a person for a pension payable to a widowed person, that person shall be deemed to have accumulated a Canadian creditable period for any period for which the person’s partner accumulated a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) but any period during which the person and the partner both accumulated Canadian creditable periods under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be taken into account once only.



**4** For the purposes of paragraph 1, where a person:

**(a)** has been an Australian resident for a continuous period which is less than the minimum continuous period required by the legislation of Australia for entitlement of that person to a benefit; and

**ARTICLE 7** 
### **Calculation of Australian Benefits**


**1** Subject to paragraph 2, where an Australian benefit is payable whether by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise to a person who is outside Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the social security laws of Australia but:

**(a)** disregarding in the calculation of his or her income:

**(i)** the guaranteed income supplement under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md);



**(ii)** the portion of the allowance under that Act equivalent to the guaranteed income supplement; and



**(iii)** other Canadian federal, provincial or territorial welfare payments of a similar character which are income or means tested, as mutually agreed by the competent authorities; and





**(b)** by assessing as income of that person and, where applicable that person’s partner, only a proportion of any other benefit received by that person and, where applicable that person’s partner, under the legislation of Canada calculated by multiplying the number of whole months, plus one, accumulated by that person in a period of Australian working life residence, but not exceeding 300, by the amount of that benefit and dividing that product by 300.





**2** A person referred to in paragraph 1 shall only be entitled to receive the concessional assessment of income described in subparagraph 1(b) for any period during which the rate of that person’s Australian benefit is proportionalised under the legislation of Australia.



**3** Where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is in Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined by:

**(a)** calculating that person’s income according to the Australian legislation but disregarding in that calculation any Canadian benefit to which the person or the person’s partner is entitled;



**(b)** deducting that Canadian benefit from the maximum rate of that Australian benefit; and



**(c)** applying to the remaining benefit obtained under subparagraph (b) the relevant rate calculation set out in the Australian legislation, using as the person’s income the amount calculated under subparagraph (a).





**4** Where the rate of a benefit calculated in accordance with paragraph 3 is less than the rate of that benefit which would be payable under paragraph 1 if the person concerned were outside Australia, the first-mentioned rate shall be increased to an amount equivalent to the second-mentioned rate.



**5** For the purposes of paragraph 4, a comparison of the rates of a benefit determined in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be made as at:

**(a)** the date of the first pension pay-day occurring after the date on which the claim for the benefit was lodged; and



**(b)** each anniversary of that pension pay-day for so long as the person concerned is entitled to the benefit, using, in that comparison, the number of months in the period of Australian working life residence accumulated by the person at the date as at which the comparison is made.





**6** For the purposes of paragraph 3, where one or the other, or both, of a person and his or her partner are entitled to receive a Canadian benefit, the total of the Canadian benefits payable to that person and his or her partner shall be apportioned equally between them and disregarded in the calculation of their respective incomes, and the amount so apportioned shall be deducted from the amount of Australian benefit that would otherwise be payable to each of them.



**ARTICLE 8** 
### **Recovery of Debts**


**1** Where:

**(a)** the competent authority of Canada pays a benefit to a person in respect of a past period;



**(b)** for all or part of that period, the competent institution of Australia has paid to that person a benefit under the legislation of Australia; and



**(c)** the amount of the Australian benefit would have been varied had the Canadian benefit been paid during that period,



then



**(d)** the amount that would not have been paid by the competent institution of Australia had the Canadian benefit been paid on a periodical basis from the date to which the arrears of benefit referred to in subparagraph (a) were paid shall be a debt due by that person to Australia; and



**(e)** the competent institution of Australia may determine that the amount, or any part, of that debt may be deducted from future payments of a benefit to that person.





**2** In paragraph 1, ***benefit*** means, in relation to Australia, a pension, benefit or allowance that is payable under the social security laws of Australia.

**2** 

**(a)** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md), a period of Australian working life residence shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.



**(b)** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year which includes a period of Australian working life residence of at least 6 calendar months shall be considered as a year for which contributions have been made under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**3** For the purposes of this Article, where a Canadian creditable period and a period of Australian working life residence coincide, the period of coincidence shall be taken into account once only as a Canadian creditable period.



**ARTICLE 10** 
### **Benefits under the Old Age Security Act**


**1** If a person is eligible for a pension or an allowance solely through the application of the totalising provisions of Article 9, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.

**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** the competent authority of Canada shall not pay a pension under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) to a person outside Canada unless his or her Canadian creditable period accumulated under that Act and period of Australian working life residence, when totalised as provided in Article 9, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** an allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).

**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit solely on the basis of the periods creditable under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), but is eligible for that benefit through the totalising of periods as provided in Article 9, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the earnings-related portion of such benefit under the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).



**2** The amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit payable by virtue of this Agreement shall, in a case referred to in paragraph 1, be determined by multiplying:

**(a)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(b)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) for eligibility for that benefit,



but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.
