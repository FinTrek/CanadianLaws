- **(2)** Remission may be granted to a manufacturer referred to in subsection (1) in respect of a period described therein only where
	- **(a)** the ratio of the net sales value of front end wheel loaders produced by the manufacturer in Canada at any time and sold by him anywhere in that period to the net sales value of all front end wheel loaders sold by the manufacturer in that period for consumption in Canada is not less than 75 to 100; and
