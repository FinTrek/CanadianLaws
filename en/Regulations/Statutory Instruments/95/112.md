**3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, if a person is not entitled to a benefit under the legislation of Canada, eligibility for that benefit shall be determined by taking into account creditable periods under the legislation of a third State with which both States are bound by an international social security instrument which provides for totalizing of periods.

**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Convention,

**a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Article 11, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and

**ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit. In no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.

Where the right to an ordinary pension under the legislation of Switzerland is subject to a current affiliation under that legislation, a Canadian national shall be considered insured under that legislation provided that, on the date the insured event occurs according to the legislation of Switzerland, he or she is insured under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) or resides in Canada within the meaning of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).



### Article 16

**3** With respect to paragraph 1 of Article 6, the income a person receives from gainful employment in the territory of Canada shall not be taken into account in the calculation of contributions required under the legislation of Switzerland.



**4** The spouse and children accompanying a detached person in Switzerland within the meaning of Article 7 shall be exempted from coverage under the legislation of Switzerland in so far as they are not pursuing gainful employment in Switzerland.



**5** The spouse and children accompanying a detached person in Canada within the meaning of Article 7 shall remain insured under the legislation of Switzerland in so far as they are not pursuing gainful employment in Canada.



**6** Canadian nationals residing in Switzerland who leave Switzerland for a period not exceeding two months shall not interrupt their residence in Switzerland within the meaning of Article 14, paragraph 2.



**7** Canadian nationals not domiciled in Switzerland who have had to forsake gainful employment in that country because of an accident or illness and who benefit from Swiss Disability Insurance rehabilitation measures or who have lived in Switzerland until the occurrence of the insured contingency shall be considered insured under the legislation of Switzerland for entitlement to benefits under Disability Insurance. Such persons shall be required to pay contributions to Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance as if they were domiciled in Switzerland.



**8** With respect to Article 16, the duration of residence in Switzerland of a Canadian national shall be considered as uninterrupted by a sojourn outside the territory of Switzerland for a period not exceeding three months within a calendar year.

**9** The refund of contributions paid under the legislation of Switzerland, carried out in accordance with the provisions of Swiss laws on the refund of contributions to foreigners and stateless persons, shall not bar the payment of extraordinary pensions in accordance with Article 16.
