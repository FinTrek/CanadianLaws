<td>13. The “position” of counsel may simply be that the sentence should take a particular form, i.e. incarceration, or may be more specific, i.e. a specified term of months or years. If counsel did not make any suggestion as to the type or length of sentence this should be indicated as well.</td>

<td>15. Where the respondent consents to the admission of fresh evidence on the appeal this evidence may be included in the appeal book or filed separately and reference may be made to the evidence in Part II of the factum. No notice of motion is required, provided that the material is clearly identified as fresh evidence and the respondent has consented to its admission. Where the respondent opposes the admission of the fresh evidence then counsel must prepare a notice of motion returnable on the date of the appeal. The evidence itself should be filed with the notice of motion, but in a sealed envelope. There must be sufficient copies for the members of the court.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16. Where the facts are complicated and somewhat lengthy counsel may wish to include a paragraph containing an overview of the facts.
