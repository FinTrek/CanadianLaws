**(b)** equal to or greater than the minimum period identified in accordance with paragraph 6 for that person,



but has accumulated both a period of residence in Australia and a Canadian creditable period which, when added together, are equal to or greater than the minimum period required for qualification for that benefit by the legislation of Australia, that Canadian creditable period shall be deemed, for the purposes of a claim for that benefit, to be a period in which that person was an Australian resident.




**2** In the case of a claim by a person for an invalid pension or pension payable to a widow, paragraph 1 shall apply only to a Canadian creditable period accumulated by that person under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).


**3** For the purposes of a claim by a person for a pension payable to a widow, that person shall, subject to Article 9, be deemed to have accumulated a Canadian creditable period for any period for which her spouse accumulated a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) but any period during which the person and her spouse both accumulated Canadian creditable periods under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be taken into account once only.


**4** For the purposes of paragraph 1, where a person:

**1** Where an Australian benefit is payable whether by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise to a person who is outside Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the social security laws of Australia but:

**(a)** disregarding in the computation of his or her income the guaranteed income supplement under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) and the portion of the spouse’s allowance under that Act equivalent to the guaranteed income supplement and other Canadian federal, provincial or territorial payments of a similar character as mutually determined from time to time in letters exchanged between the Ministers respectively administering the legislation of Australia and Canada; and



**(b)** by assessing as income to that person only a proportion of any other benefit received by that person under the legislation of Canada calculated by *multiplying* the number of whole months, plus one, accumulated by that person in a period of residence in Australia, but not exceeding 300, by the amount of that benefit and *dividing* that product by 300.




**2** Where an Australian benefit is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who is in Australia, the rate of that benefit shall be determined according to the legislation of Australia but, subject to paragraph 5, disregarding in the computation of his or her income any Canadian benefit which that person is entitled to receive, and deducting the amount of that Canadian benefit from the rate of Australian benefit which would otherwise be payable to that person.


**3** Where the rate of a benefit calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 is less than the rate of that benefit which would be payable under paragraph 1 if the person concerned were outside Australia, the first-mentioned rate shall be increased to an amount equivalent to the second-mentioned rate.


**4** For the purposes of paragraph 3, a comparison of the rates of a benefit determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be made as at:

**(a)** the date of the first pension pay-day occurring after the date on which the claim for the benefit was lodged; and



**(b)** each anniversary of that pension pay-day for so long as the person concerned is entitled to the benefit, using, in that comparison, the number of months in the period of residence in Australia accumulated by the person at the date as at which the comparison is made.




**5** For the purposes of paragraph 2, where one or other, or both, of a person and his or her spouse are entitled to receive a Canadian benefit, the total of the Canadian benefits payable to that person and his or her spouse shall be apportioned equally between them and disregarded in the computation of their respective incomes, and the amount so apportioned shall be deducted from the amount of Australian benefit that would otherwise be payable to each of them.


**6** An Australian benefit that is payable only by virtue of this Agreement to a person who:

**(a)** was an Australian resident on 8 May 1985; and



**(b)** commences to receive that benefit before 1 January 1996



shall be paid, during any absence of that person from Australia that commences before 1 January 1996, at a rate calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.




**7** As soon as practicable after an exchange of letters in which Canadian federal, provincial or territorial payments are mutually determined for the purposes of subparagraph 1(a), the Minister administering the legislation of Australia shall cause to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette a notice specifying those Canadian payments.



**ARTICLE 8** 
### Wives’ Pensions and Carers’ Pensions

For the purposes of this Agreement, a person who receives an Australian wife’s pension or carer’s pension due to the fact that the spouse of that person receives, by virtue of this Agreement, an Australian benefit shall be deemed to receive that pension by virtue of this Agreement.



**ARTICLE 9** 
### Pensions Payable to Widows

Where, under the legislation of Australia, a widow lodges a claim for a pension payable to a widow, matters which concern her former spouse and affect that claim shall be considered for the purposes of that claim by reference only to her last-deceased spouse who was her husband or was a man in respect of whom she satisfies the conditions specified in subparagraph (ii) of the definition of “widow” in Article 1.



**PART III** 
## Provisions Relating to Canadian Benefits


**ARTICLE 10** 
### Totalising of Periods for Purposes of the Legislation of Canada

**2** 

**(a)** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md), a period of residence in Australia shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada.



**(b)** For the purposes of determining eligibility for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year which includes a period of residence in Australia of at least six calendar months shall be considered as a year for which contributions have been made under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).

**(b)** The amount of the pension payable shall, in this case, be calculated under the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension, exclusively on the basis of the periods creditable under that Act.

**(b)** a spouse’s allowance shall not be payable by virtue of this Agreement to a person who has not accumulated a Canadian creditable period of at least one year under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md); and



**(c)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).
