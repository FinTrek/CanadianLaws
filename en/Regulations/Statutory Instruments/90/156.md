- **(2)** All other words and expressions used in these Specifications have the same meaning as in the Regulations.




## Application


**3** These Specifications apply in respect of registers and ancillary equipment that are intended for use with positive displacement meters for liquids.




## Design, Composition and Construction



### Pulsers for Use with Registers


**4** A pulser shall be designed so that a register meets the applicable requirements of these Specifications when the tests described in sections 29 to 31 are carried out.



**5** A register shall be equipped with a dual-channel pulser, or with two pulsers, that generates dual pulses corresponding to the liquid flow.



**6** A pulser of a register designed to be used in a metering installation that does not incorporate a non-return check-valve shall generate pulses when a reverse flow of liquid occurs through the meter, and the pulse processing system shall distinguish pulses generated by reverse flow from those pulses generated by forward flow.




### Pulse Processing Systems


**7** A register shall detect false or missing pulses in the train of pulses from the pulser to the pulse processing system throughout the range of input frequencies over which the register is designed to be used.



**8** Except as provided in section 9, any means of adjustment that is used for processing pulses in order to vary measurement results shall be sealable and located so as to be inaccessible without the removal of a portion of the exterior housing of the register.



**9** Any means of adjustment that is accessible without the removal of a portion of the exterior housing of the register shall
- **(a)** have an adjustment range of not more than ±2 per cent of the volume of liquid to be delivered;
- **(b)** be sealable; and
- **(c)** not be adjustable while the register is operating.



**10** A register may incorporate a means of adjustment that automatically selects a predetermined correction factor that corresponds to the rate of flow, in order to linearize the meter accuracy/flow rate performance curve, where
- **(a)** no factor can be adjusted to deviate from the adjacent factor by more than 0.25 per cent; and
- **(b)** the register is designed so that programmed correction factors are readily verifiable either by means of the display or printing of the programmed correction factors or by any other means, such as switch settings or jumper locations accompanied by suitable codes or legends.



**11** 

- **(1)** A pulse processing system of a register that is intended for use in a metering installation in which a reverse flow of liquid through the meter can occur shall, in the case of such a reverse flow of liquid, subtract from all registrations the quantity corresponding to the volume of the reverse flow of liquid.

- **(2)** Where the pulse processing system of a register does not comply with subsection (1), the system shall not be approved pursuant to section 3 of the Act unless the use of the system is restricted to metering installations in which a reverse flow of liquid cannot occur.




### Controls and Interlocks


**12** 

- **(1)** A register, other than a non-resettable register, that incorporates an electronic display shall
	- **(a)** automatically supply electrical power to all display segments for at least 0.5 seconds and cut the power for at least 0.5 seconds after the register is reset to zero and before the next delivery is started, to allow an operator to detect any fault in a segment or in a circuit of the segment; or
	- **(b)** incorporate an automatic self-testing system that checks the operation of all display segments prior to starting a delivery and, where a fault is detected, prevents the delivery.

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of secondary registers that display the same information as the primary register.



**13** A register shall be designed so that the unit price cannot be changed while the register is computing the total price for a delivery.



**14** A register shall be designed so that it automatically locks the register display and causes the liquid flow to stop where, during a delivery, false or missing pulses are detected that represent a quantity of liquid in excess of an amount that is the greater of
- **(a)** five times the applicable minimum increment of registration set out in section 20, and
- **(b)** one increment for every 1,000 increments registered during the delivery.



**15** The quantity and, where applicable, the unit price and the total price shall remain displayed for at least five minutes after a delivery unless
- **(a)** the next transaction is initiated; or
- **(b)** the current transaction is finalized.



**16** Where a metering assembly incorporates a selective means of adjustment that permits a meter to accurately measure different liquids, or permits the register to be used with different meters, the selection of the liquids or meters shall be interlocked so that
- **(a)** the adjustment selection corresponds to the liquid or meter selected; and
- **(b)** the unit price, where applicable, corresponds to the unit price of the liquid selected.



**17** A metering assembly that can be used with more than one liquid or incorporates more than one meter shall be designed to prevent the selection mechanism from operating after the registration of a value equal to 10 times the applicable minimum increment of registration set out in section 20, except where the register of the metering assembly is automatically reset to zero following the selection.



**18** A register that is intended for use with more than one meter or for more than one liquid shall be designed to incorporate a means to automatically prevent the delivery of more than one liquid at a time.



**19** In order to mask the effect of hose expansion on the registrations of a register, displayed values may be suppressed in a register up to a value equal to three times the applicable minimum increment of registration set out in section 20.




### Registrations


**20** Every registration of a metering assembly, other than a registration of a non-resettable register, shall have at least the following number of digits and not more than the following value as minimum increment of registration:
- **(a)** four digits and 0.001 L or 0.0001 gallons, in the case of registers for use with meters designed for a maximum flow rate of 5 L or less per minute;
- **(b)** five digits and 0.001 L or 0.0001 gallons, in the case of registers for use with meters designed for a maximum flow rate of more than 5 L per minute but not more than 20 L per minute;
