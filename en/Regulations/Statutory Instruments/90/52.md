**Chapter 1**
### Totalizing of Periods


**ARTICLE VIII**

**ARTICLE IX** 


If a person is not entitled to a benefit on the basis of the periods creditable under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in this Agreement, eligibility for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and the periods creditable under the law of a third State with which both Parties are bound by an international social security instrument which provides for totalizing of periods.
