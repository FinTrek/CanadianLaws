## Provisions Concerning Benefits


**Chapter 1** 
### Totalizing


**ARTICLE 12** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Romania


**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4, provided that the periods do not overlap.



**2** For the purpose of determining eligibility for a benefit:

**(a)** under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada, a creditable period under the legislation of Romania shall be considered as a period of residence in Canada;

**3** For the purpose of determining eligibility for an old age benefit under the legislation of Romania:

**(a)** a calendar year which is a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as 12 months which are creditable under the legislation of Romania;



**(b)** a month which is a creditable period under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) of Canada and which does not overlap with a creditable period under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) shall be considered as a month which is creditable under the legislation of Romania.

**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State


If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of either Party, totalized as provided in Article 12, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and periods completed under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods. Only periods which can be considered under the totalizing provisions of the relevant instrument with that third State shall be taken into account.



**ARTICLE 14** 
#### Minimum Period to be Totalized


Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the total duration of the creditable periods accumulated under the legislation of a Party is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists under the legislation of that Party, the competent institution of that Party shall not be required to pay a benefit in respect of those periods by virtue of this Agreement. These creditable periods shall, however, be taken into consideration by the competent institution of the other Party to determine eligibility for the benefits of that Party through the application of Chapter 1.



**Chapter 2** 
### Benefits under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 15** 
#### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be eligible for a full pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**3** An Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada.



**ARTICLE 16** 
#### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan


If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan;



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.







**Chapter 3** 
### Benefits under the Legislation of Romania


**ARTICLE 17** 
#### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable


**1** If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Romania shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the theoretical amount of the benefit shall be calculated as if all the creditable periods were completed under the legislation of Romania; and



**(b)** on the basis of the theoretical amount calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph 1 (a), shall determine the amount of the benefit payable by applying the ratio of the length of the creditable periods under the legislation of Romania to the totalized creditable periods.





**2** If the amount of the benefit is determined taking into account the number of beneficiaries, the competent institution of Romania shall also take into account persons who reside or stay in Canada.
