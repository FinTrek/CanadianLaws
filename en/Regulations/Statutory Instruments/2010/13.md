**ARTICLE 8** 
#### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and the Kingdom of Morocco

If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit on the basis of the periods of insurance under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 8, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and periods of insurance under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for totalizing of periods of insurance.



**ARTICLE 10** 
#### Minimum Insurance Period


**1** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Convention, if the total duration of the periods of insurance accumulated under the legislation of Canada is less than one year and if, taking into account only those periods, no right to a benefit exists, the competent institution of Canada shall not be required to pay benefits.

**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the Old Age Security Act governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.

**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Convention:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall not be paid to a person who is outside Canada unless that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**CHAPTER 3** 
### Benefits Under the Legislation of the Kingdom of Morocco


**ARTICLE 13** 
#### Calculating the Amount of Benefit

**ARTICLE 14** 
#### Payment of Benefit


Benefits to which an insured person who has been subject to the legislation of both Parties is entitled under the legislation of the Kingdom of Morocco, shall be calculated as follows:

**(a)** the competent institution of the Kingdom of Morocco shall determine, according to its own legislation, if the insured person meets the entitlement conditions to benefits under that legislation, taking into account the totalizing of periods specified in Articles 8 and 9,



**(b)** if, after applying the totalizing provisions of subparagraph (a), the claimant is entitled to an old age, disability or survivors benefit under the legislation of the Kingdom of Morocco, the competent institution of the Kingdom of Morocco shall determine the theoretical benefit to which the insured person would be entitled if all the periods of insurance had been completed under its own legislation,



**(c)** the benefit payable to the insured person is established by reducing the amount of the theoretical benefit specified in subparagraph (b) by prorating the periods of insurance completed under the legislation of the Kingdom of Morocco in relation to the total periods of insurance totalized through the application of Articles 8 and 9.





**ARTICLE 15** 
#### Special Schemes


**1** If in the application of the legislation of the Kingdom of Morocco, the entitlement to certain benefits is subject to the condition that the periods of insurance must have been completed in a profession subject to a special scheme, or in a particular profession or employment, then the periods of insurance completed under the legislation of Canada shall be taken into account to determine the entitlement to a benefit only if these periods of insurance were completed in the same profession or employment.



**2** If, taking into account the periods of insurance so completed, the person concerned does not fulfill the conditions required to be entitled to those benefits, such periods of insurance shall be taken into account for the entitlement to benefits under the general scheme.



**ARTICLE 16** 
#### Payment of a Survivors’ Pension


**1** If a death establishing entitlement to the payment of a survivors’ pension occurs before the worker became entitled to the payment of an old age pension, the benefits payable to his or her survivors shall be determined in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 14 of this Convention.



**2** The widow’s pension eventually is divided, equally and definitively, between the beneficiaries, according to the conditions provided by the personal statute of the insured person.
