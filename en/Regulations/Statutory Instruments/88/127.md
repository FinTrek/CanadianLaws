When creditable periods of coverage have been completed under the legislation of both Contracting States, the competent institution of each Contracting State shall, in determining eligibility for benefits under the legislation which it applies, take into account, to the extent necessary, periods which are creditable under the legislation of the other Contracting State, provided that such periods do not overlap with periods creditable under its legislation.



**ARTICLE 13**

The following shall apply as regards benefits payable under the Old Age Security Act of Canada:

**(a)** For purposes of determining eligibility for a pension or a spouse’s allowance payable under the Old Age Security Act through the application of Article 12, a period of residence in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, after the age at which periods of residence in Canada are creditable for purposes of that Act, shall be considered as a period of residence in the territory of Canada.



**(b)** (i) If a person is entitled to payment of a pension in Canada under the Old Age Security Act without recourse to the provisions of this Agreement, but has not accumulated sufficient periods of residence in Canada to qualify for payment of the pension abroad under that Act, a partial pension shall be payable to him outside the territory of Canada if the periods of residence in the territories of the two Contracting States, when totalized as provided in Article 12, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the Old Age Security Act for payment of a pension abroad.

**(ii)** The amount of the pension payable shall, in this case, be calculated in conformity with the provisions of the Old Age Security Act governing the payment of a partial pension, exclusively on the basis of the periods creditable under that legislation.





**(c)** (i) If a person is not entitled to an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely on the basis of periods of residence in Canada, a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance shall be payable to him if the periods of residence in the territories of the two Contracting States, when totalized as provided in Article 12, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the Old Age Security Act for payment of a pension or a spouse’s allowance.

**(ii)** The amount of the pension or the spouse’s allowance payable shall, in this case, be calculated in conformity with the provisions of the Old Age Security Act governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods creditable under that legislation.





**(d)** (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the competent institution of Canada shall pay an Old Age Security pension outside the territory of Canada only if the periods of residence in the territories of the two Contracting States, when totalized as provided in Article 12, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the Old Age Security Act for the payment of a pension abroad.

**(ii)** The spouse’s allowance and the guaranteed income supplement shall be payable outside the territory of Canada only to the extent permitted by the Old Age Security Act.

**(b)** (i) If a person is not entitled to a disability pension, disabled contributor’s child’s benefit, survivor’s pension, orphan’s benefit, or death benefit solely on the basis of the periods creditable under the Canada Pension Plan, but is entitled to that benefit through totalizing periods of coverage as provided in Article 12, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the earnings-related portion of such benefit in conformity with the provisions of the Canada Pension Plan, exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings credited under that legislation.

**(ii)** The amount of the flat rate portion of the benefit payable under the provisions of this Agreement shall, in this case, be determined by multiplying:

the amount of the flat rate portion of the benefit determined under the provisions of the Canada Pension Plan by



the ratio that the periods of contributions to the Canada Pension Plan represent in relation to the minimum qualifying period for entitlement to that benefit under the Canada Pension Plan.







**(c)** No benefit shall be paid under this Article unless the contributor has reached an age at which his contributory period, as defined in the Canada Pension Plan, is at least equal to the minimum qualifying period under the legislation of Canada for entitlement to the benefit in question.
