### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Grenada

**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).

## Benefits Under the Legislation of Grenada


**ARTICLE XIII** 
### Calculating the Amount of Pension Payable

**1** If a person is not eligible for a pension solely on the basis of the periods creditable under the legislation of Grenada, but is eligible for that pension through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Grenada shall calculate the amount of pension payable in the following manner:

**(a)** it shall first establish the rate of the pension which would be payable if the person qualified for the pension on the basis of creditable periods completed under the legislation of Grenada alone;



**(b)** it shall then multiply that rate by the fraction which represents the ratio of the actual creditable periods under the legislation of Grenada in relation to the minimum creditable period required to establish entitlement to that pension under that legislation.




**2** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, where a grant is payable under the legislation of Grenada, but entitlement to a pension under that legislation can be established through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the pension shall be paid in lieu of the grant.


**3** Where a grant was paid under the legislation of Grenada in respect of an event which happened before the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and where entitlement to a pension under that legislation is subsequently established through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Grenada may deduct from any pension payable any amount previously paid in the form of a grant.
