**6** An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.

**7** The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.”

## Dividends
**1** Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

**2** However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:

**(a)** 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company liable to corporation tax which:

**(i)** controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends where that company is a resident of Canada;



**(ii)** holds directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends where that company is a resident of France;





**(b)** notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a), 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if they are paid by a non-resident owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada to a company that is a resident of France and that controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;



**(c)** 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.



The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.



**3** 

**(a)** A resident of Canada who is the beneficial owner of dividends received from a company which is a resident of France, which dividends, if received by a resident of France would entitle such resident to a tax credit (“avoir fiscal”), shall be entitled to a payment from the French Treasury of an amount equal to such tax credit (“avoir fiscal”), subject to the deduction from such payment of the tax provided for in subparagraph (c) of paragraph 2.



**(b)** The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall apply only to a resident of Canada who is:

**(i)** an individual; or



**(ii)** a company other than a company that holds directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company resident in France paying the dividends.





**(c)** The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends is not liable to Canadian tax on the dividends and the payment of the French Treasury. However, the competent authorities of the Contracting States may agree to also apply the provisions of subparagraph (a) to any organisation referred to in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 7 of Article 29, but only with respect to that part of the dividends which corresponds to the rights owned in such organisations by residents of Canada and provided that, if so requested by the competent authorities, that part of the dividends is taxed in the hands of such residents.



**(d)** The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends does not, when asked by the French tax administration, justify that he is the owner of the interest giving rise to the payment of the dividends and that the holding of that interest does not have as its main objective, or as one of its main objectives, to allow another person, whether a resident of a Contracting State or not, to take advantage of the provisions of subparagraph (a).



**(e)** The gross amount of the payment from the French Treasury referred to in subparagraph (a) shall be treated as a dividend for the application of this Convention.



**4** A resident of Canada who receives dividends paid by a company which is a resident of France shall, unless it is eligible to receive a payment from the French Treasury referred to in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3, be entitled to the refund of the prepayment to the extent that the prepayment has effectively been paid by the company with respect to the dividends. The gross amount of the prepayment refunded shall be deemed to be a dividend for the purposes of the Convention. It may be taxed in France in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.

**5** The term ***dividends*** as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the taxation treatment of distributions or to same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

**6** The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

**7** Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

**8** Nothing in the Convention shall prevent a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings attributable to a permanent establishment, situated in that State, of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State a tax in addition to the tax allowable under the other provisions of the Convention, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings. This additional tax shall also apply to profits or gains derived from the alienation of immovable property situated in a Contracting State by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, whether or not that company has a permanent establishment in the first-mentioned State. For the purpose of this provision, the term ***earnings*** means the profits or gains after deducting therefrom the taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits or gains by the first-mentioned State.”





**ARTICLE 8** 


Subparagraph (c) of paragraph 3 of Article 11 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“(c)** is paid with respect to indebtedness resulting from the sale or furnishing on credit by a resident of the other Contracting State of any equipment, merchandise or services, except where the sale or furnishing is made between associated enterprises within the meaning of subparagraphs (a) or (b) of Article 9 or where the payer and the recipient of the interest are associated enterprises within the meaning of the same subparagraphs.”

**1** Paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“3** Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2:

**(a)** royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner of the royalties, shall be taxable only in that other State if they are:

**(i)** copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work (but not including royalties in respect of motion picture films nor royalties in respect of works on film or videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television broadcasting), or

**(e)** Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income or capital, take into account the exempted income or capital.”





**2** Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 23 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“2** In the case of France, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

**(a)** income arising in Canada and taxable or taxable only in Canada in accordance with the provisions of the Convention shall be taken into account in calculating the French tax when the recipient is a resident of France and the income is not exempt from the corporation tax under French law. In such case, the Canadian tax shall not be deductible from such income, but the recipient shall be entitled to a tax credit deductible from the French tax. This tax credit is equal:

**(i)** for income not referred to in (ii), to the amount of French tax corresponding to such income;



**(ii)** for income referred to in Articles 10, 11 and 12, in paragraphs 1 and 5 of Article 13, in paragraph 3 of Article 15, in Article 16, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 17, in paragraph 3 of Article 18 and in Article 21, to the amount of tax paid in Canada in accordance with the provisions of those Articles; however, it may not exceed the amount of French tax corresponding to such income. It is understood that the term ***amount of tax paid in Canada*** means the amount of Canadian tax effectively and finally paid in respect of such income, in accordance with the Convention, by the resident of France receiving such income.





**(b)** A resident of France who owns taxable capital in Canada in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 or 4 of Article 22 may also be taxed in France in respect of such capital. The French tax is calculated subject to a deduction of a tax credit equal to the amount of Canadian tax on such capital. This tax credit shall not exceed that amount of the French tax which is attributable to such capital.



**(c)** Notwithstanding any other provision of the Convention:

**(i)** where a deceased person was at the time of his death a resident of France, France shall apply the inheritance tax to all of the property taxable in accordance with its domestic legislation and shall allow as a deduction from that tax an amount equal to the Canadian tax paid on the gains which, at the time of death and under the provisions of the Convention, were taxable in Canada; such deduction shall not, however, exceed that share of the French inheritance tax, as computed before the deduction is given, attributable to the property in respect of which the deduction shall be allowed;



**(ii)** where a deceased person was at the time of his death a resident of Canada, France shall apply the inheritance tax to all of the property taxable in accordance with its domestic legislation and shall allow as a deduction from that tax an amount equal to the Canadian tax paid on the gains which, at the time of death and under the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 13, were taxable only in Canada, and that are not referred to in paragraph 5 of the same Article; such deduction shall not, however, exceed the lessor of the two following shares:

**(aa)** the share of the inheritance tax, as calculated before the deduction is given, attributable to the property from the alienation of which are derived the gains referred to above and in respect of which the deduction shall be allowed; and



**(bb)** the share of the Canadian tax attributable to such property, as calculated before the deduction provided for in paragraph 1(c).







**(d)** It is understood that the term ***amount of French tax corresponding to such income*** used in subparagraph (a) means:

**(i)** where the tax payable in respect of such income is calculated by applying a proportional rate, the product of the taxable amount of such net income multiplied by the rate which is applied to such net income;



**(ii)** where the tax payable in respect of such income is calculated by applying a progressive scale, the product of the taxable amount of such net income multiplied by the rate resulting from the ratio between the tax actually payable in respect of the total net income taxable under the laws of France and the amount of such total net income.



This interpretation applies by analogy to the term ***that amount of the French tax which is attributable to such capital*** used in subparagraph (b) as well as to the terms ***share of the French inheritance tax, as calculated before the deduction is given, attributable to the property in respect of which the deduction shall be allowed*** and ***share of the Canadian tax attributable to such property*** used in subparagraph (c).





**3** The provisions of the Convention, and in particular those of this Article, shall not prevent the application of the domestic legislation of a Contracting State:

**(a)** which authorizes enterprises of that State to determine their taxable profits on the basis of a consolidation which may includes the results of subsidiaries which are resident in the other Contracting State, or permanent establishments situated in that other State; or



**(b)** in accordance with which the first-mentioned State determines the taxable profits of enterprises of that first-mentioned State by deducting the losses of subsidiaries which are resident in the other Contracting State or of permanent establishments situated in that other State, and by including the profits of these subsidiaries or of these permanent establishments up to the amount of the losses deducted.”







**ARTICLE 17** 


Paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“1** Individuals who are nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subject in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which individuals who are nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected, notably with respect to the residence. This provision shall apply to individuals whether or not they are residents of one of the Contracting States.”





**ARTICLE 18** 


**1** Paragraph 3 of Article 25 of the Convention shall be deleted and paragraphs 4 and 5 shall become paragraphs 3 and 4 respectively.



**2** There shall be added to Article 25 of the Convention a new paragraph 5, written as follows:**“5** If any question, difficulty or doubt arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention cannot be resolved or dealt with by the competent authorities as a result of the application of the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 or 3, these questions, difficulties or doubts may, if the competent authorities agree, be submitted to an arbitration commission. The decisions of the commission shall have the force of law. The composition of the commission and the arbitration procedures shall be determined, after consultation between the competent authorities, through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The provisions of this paragraph shall take effect from the date agreed to in the exchange of diplomatic notes.”





**ARTICLE 19** 


Article 26 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:

**“ARTICLE 26** 
## Exchange of Information
**1** The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

**2** In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

**(a)** to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(b)** to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;



**(c)** to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).”







**ARTICLE 20** 


**1** Paragraph 1 of Article 29 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“1** The provisions of this Convention shall not prevent:

**(a)** Canada from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of Canada with respect to a partnership, trust, or controlled foreign affiliate, in which he has an interest;



**(b)** France from applying the provisions of Articles 209B and 212 of the “Code général des impôts” or other identical or substantially similar provisions which would amend or replace them.”







**2** Paragraph 3 of Article 29 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“3** The competent authorities of the Contracting States may settle the mode of application of the Convention. In particular, they may prescribe the formalities that must be followed by a resident of a Contracting State to obtain, in the other Contracting State, the exemptions or reductions of tax or other tax benefits provided for by the Convention. Such formalities may include the filing of a form certifying residency, indicating in particular the nature and the amount or value of the income or of the capital in question, certified by the tax authorities of the first-mentioned State.”





**3** Paragraph 5 of Article 29 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following:**“5** Contributions in a year in respect of services rendered in that year paid by, or on behalf of, an individual who is a resident of one of the Contracting States or who is temporarily present in that State, to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in the other Contracting State shall, during a period not exceeding in the aggregate sixty months, be treated in the same way for tax purposes in the first-mentioned State as a contribution paid to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in the first-mentioned State, provided that:

**(a)** such individual was regularly contributing to the pension plan (or to another pension plan for which that plan has been substituted) over a period ending immediately before he became a resident of or temporarily present in the first-mentioned State; and



**(b)** the competent authority of the first-mentioned State agrees that the pension plan corresponds generally to a pension plan recognized for tax purposes by that State.



For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ***pension plan*** includes especially a pension plan created under a public social security system.”







**4** There shall be added to Article 29 of the Convention a new paragraph 7, written as follows:**“7** 

**(a)** A mutual fund in securities constituted and established in a Contracting State, not subject to tax in that State, and which receives dividends paid by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State or interest arising in that other State, may claim as a whole the benefit of the reductions or exemptions of taxes provided for under the Convention for the fraction of the income which corresponds to the rights held in that organisation by residents of the first-mentioned State and which is taxable in the hands of those residents.



**(b)** Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to an organisation that was constituted and is established in the other Contracting State and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension or retirement plans, shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State provided that:

**(i)** the organisation is the beneficial owner of the dividends and is generally exempt from tax in the other State; and



**(ii)** the organisation does not own directly or indirectly more than 5 per cent of the capital nor more than 5 per cent of the voting stock of the company paying the dividends; and



**(iii)** the principal class of shares of the company paying the dividends is regularly traded on a stock exchange situated in the first-mentioned State.





**(c)** Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 11, interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to an organisation that was constituted and is established in the other Contracting State and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension or retirement plans, shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State provided that:

**(i)** the organisation is the beneficial owner of the interest and is generally exempt from tax in the other State; and



**(ii)** the interest is not derived from the carrying on a trade or a business by the organisation or from an associated person within the meaning of subparagraphs (a) or (b) of Article 9.”









**5** There shall be added to Article 29 of the Convention a new paragraph 8, written as follows:**“8** Where an enterprise of a Contracting State that is exempt from tax in that State on the profits of its permanent establishments which are not situated in that State derives income from the other Contracting State, and that income is attributable to a permanent establishment which that enterprise has in a third jurisdiction, the tax benefits that would otherwise apply under the other provisions of the Convention will not apply to any item of income on which the combined tax in the first-mentioned State and in the third jurisdiction is less than 60 per cent of the tax that would be imposed in the first-mentioned State if the income were earned or received in that State by the enterprise and were not attributable to the permanent establishment in the third jurisdiction. Any dividends, interest, or royalties to which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax in the other State at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent of the gross amount thereof. Any other income to which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax under the provisions of the domestic law of the other State, notwithstanding any other provision of the Convention. The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply:

**(a)** if the income derived from the other State is in connection with or incidental to the active conduct of a trade or business carried on by the permanent establishment in the third jurisdiction (other than the business of making or managing investments unless these activities are banking or insurance activities carried on by a bank or insurance company);



**(b)** if, when France is the first-mentioned State, France taxes the profits of such permanent establishment according to the provisions of Articles 209B or 209 quinquies of the French “Code général des impôts”, as they may be amended without changing the general principle hereof; or



**(c)** when France is the first-mentioned State, to income taxed by Canada according to section 91 of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md), as it may be amended without changing the general principle hereof.”







**6** There shall be added to Article 29 of the Convention a new paragraph 9, written as follows:**“9** Subject to reciprocity, the exemptions from tax and other tax benefits provided for by French laws for the benefit of the French State, its local authorities or their agencies or instrumentalities whose activities are not the carrying on of a trade or business, shall apply in the same conditions respectively to:

**(a)** the Canadian State, its provinces, or organisations whose activities are not the carrying on of a trade or business, created within the framework of an agreement concluded or approved by the Contracting States;



**(b)** Canadian local authorities;



**(c)** agencies or instrumentalities of the Canadian State, its provinces or its local authorities, whose activities are identical or substantially similar to those of the French instrumentalities considered.



The provisions of this paragraph shall also apply, subject to reciprocity, to French taxes other than those referred to in Article 2, except for taxes owed in respect of services rendered.”







**7** Paragraph 7 of Article 29 of the Convention shall become paragraph 10.



**ARTICLE 21** 


**1** Each Contracting State shall notify to the other the completion of the procedure required for the bringing into force of this Protocol. The Protocol shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the day on which the later of these notifications is received.



**2** The provisions of the Protocol shall apply:
