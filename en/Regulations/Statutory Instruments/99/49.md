**ARTICLE 8** 
### Periods under the Legislation of Canada and Croatia

**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit because he or she has not accumulated sufficient creditable periods under the legislation of a Party, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraphs 2 through 4 of this Article, provided that the periods do not overlap.

**ARTICLE 9** 
### Periods under the Legislation of a Third State

**1** If a person is not eligible for a benefit on the basis of the creditable periods under the legislation of the Parties, totalized as provided in Article 8 of this Agreement, the eligibility of that person for that benefit shall be determined by totalizing these periods and creditable periods completed under the legislation of a third State with which both Parties are bound by social security instruments which provide for the totalizing of periods.

### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**1** If a person is eligible for an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1 of Part III of this Agreement, the competent institution of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act.

**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, when totalized as provided in Chapter 1 of Part III of this Agreement, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).

**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish eligibility for that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.

### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable

**1** If a person is eligible for a benefit solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1 of Part III of this Agreement, the competent institution of Croatia shall determine the amount of the benefit payable exclusively on the basis of Croatian creditable periods, when this is possible under the applicable Croatian legislation. If the amount of the benefit cannot be determined according to the previous sentence, it shall be determined in the following manner:

**(a)** The competent institution of Croatia shall determine whether the eligibility for a benefit exists, taking into account the total creditable periods as if they all were completed under the legislation of Croatia, and the amount of the benefit payable shall be determined as the ratio between the creditable periods under the legislation of Croatia and the total of all creditable periods.



**(b)** Notwithstanding the provision of sub-paragraph 1(a) of this Article, if the total length of all creditable periods, totalized according to the provisions of Chapter 1 of Part III of this Agreement, exceeds the maximum period specified under the legislation of Croatia for the calculation of a benefit, the amount of the benefit payable shall be determined as the ratio between the creditable periods under the legislation of Croatia and that maximum period.
