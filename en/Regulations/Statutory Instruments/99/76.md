**ARTICLE XIII** 
### Calculating the Amount of Benefit Payable

**1** If a person is not entitled to a retirement pension or a survivors’ benefit solely on the basis of the periods creditable under the legislation of Trinidad and Tobago, but is entitled to that pension or benefit through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Trinidad and Tobago shall calculate the value of benefit payable in the following manner:

**3** Where a retirement grant was paid under the legislation of Trinidad and Tobago in respect of an event which happened before the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and where entitlement to a retirement pension under that legislation is subsequently established through the application of the totalizing provisions of Chapter 1, the competent institution of Trinidad and Tobago shall deduct from any retirement pension payable any amount previously paid in the form of a retirement grant.
