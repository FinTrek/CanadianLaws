## Remission of Goods and Services Tax


**2** Subject to sections 3 to 5, a registrant who, at any time during the eligible period, made eligible supplies is hereby granted, with respect to a reporting period of the registrant beginning in the eligible period, remission of tax payable under Part IX of the Act in respect of eligible supplies made by the registrant, determined by the formula
```
A - B
```
 where
- **A** is the positive or negative amount of the registrant’s net tax for the reporting period; and
- **B** is the positive or negative amount that would have been the registrant’s net tax for the reporting period if that net tax did not include any amount collected or collectible by the registrant as or on account of tax under Division II of Part IX of the Act in respect of eligible supplies.



**3** The amount of the remission under section 2 with respect to a reporting period of the registrant is reduced by the total of all amounts that were collected or collectible by the registrant as or on account of tax under Division II of Part IX of the Act in respect of eligible supplies and that are included in the net tax for the reporting period, or portion of that net tax, that remains unpaid at the time the registrant files an application for remission under section 5, if
- **(a)** that net tax is a positive amount;
- **(b)** an assessment of that net tax has not been made under section 296 of the Act before the time at which the registrant files the application; and
- **(c)** such assessment cannot, because of section 298 of the Act, be made at or after that time.



**4** Remission of interest and penalties paid by a registrant in respect of any amount for which a remission under section 2 is granted is hereby granted to the registrant.




## Condition


**5** A remission shall be granted if a registrant files an application in writing for the remission with the Minister of National Revenue not later than two years after the day on which this Order is made, except to the extent to which the amount has otherwise been rebated, credited or remitted to the registrant under the Act or the [Financial Administration Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-11.md).
