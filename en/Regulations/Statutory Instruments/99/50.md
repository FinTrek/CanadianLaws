**8** The competent authorities of the Contracting States may, by common agreement, grant an exception to the provisions of this Article with respect to any person or categories of persons, provided that any affected person shall be subject to the legislation of one of the Contracting States.

**PART III** 
## Provisions on Benefits


**CHAPTER 1** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Korea


**ARTICLE 7** 
### Totalizing and Benefits

**1** If a person is not eligible for old-age, survivors or disability benefits under the legislation of Korea based on periods of coverage credited exclusively under the legislation of Korea, the agency of Korea shall take into account the person’s periods of coverage credited under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), insofar as they do not coincide, for the purpose of establishing the person’s entitlement to benefits under the legislation of Korea. The preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of establishing entitlement to old age, survivors or disability benefits unless the person has completed at least twelve months of coverage under the legislation of Korea.


**2** To obtain a disability benefit or survivors benefit, the requirement of the legislation of Korea that a person be covered when the insured event occurs shall be considered to have been met if the person is insured for a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) during a period in which the insured event occurs according to the legislation of Korea.


**3** In determining eligibility for benefits under this Article, the agency of Korea shall credit twelve months of coverage for every year of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) certified as creditable by the agency of Canada.


**4** Where periods of coverage under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) are taken into account to establish eligibility for benefits under the legislation of Korea in accordance with this Article, the benefit due shall be determined as follows:

**(a)** The agency of Korea shall first compute a Basic Pension Amount equal to the amount that would have been payable to the person if all the periods of coverage credited under the legislation of both Contracting States had been completed under the legislation of Korea. To determine the Basic Pension Amount, the agency of Korea shall take into account the person’s average standard monthly income while covered under the legislation of Korea.



**(b)** The agency of Korea shall calculate the partial benefit to be paid in accordance with the legislation of Korea based on the Basic Pension Amount calculated according to the preceding sub-paragraph, in proportion to the ratio between the duration of the periods of coverage taken into consideration under its own legislation and the total duration of the periods of coverage taken into consideration under the legislation of both Contracting States.




**5** Entitlement to a benefit from Korea which results from paragraph 1 shall terminate with the acquisition of sufficient periods of coverage under the legislation of Korea to establish entitlement to an equal or higher benefit without the need to invoke the provision of paragraph 1.



**CHAPTER 2** 
## Benefits Under the Legislation of Canada


**ARTICLE 8** 
### Totalizing

**1. (a)** If a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit because the person has not accumulated sufficient periods of coverage under the legislation of Canada, the entitlement of that person to the payment of that benefit shall, subject to sub-paragraph 1(b), be determined by totalizing these periods and those specified in paragraph 2, provided that the periods do not overlap.


**(b)** In the application of sub-paragraph 1(a) to the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md),

**(i)** the agency of Canada shall be required to totalize periods to determine a person’s entitlement to a benefit only if that person has completed at least twelve months of residence in Canada as defined in that Act, without reference to sub-paragraph 2(a) of this Article but subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (b)(ii) of this paragraph; and



**(ii)** only periods of residence in Canada completed on or after 1 January 1988, including periods deemed as such under Article 6, shall be taken into account.




**2. (a)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md), a month which is a period of coverage under the legislation of Korea and which is completed after the age at which periods of residence in Canada are credited for purposes of that Act shall be considered as a month of residence in Canada.

**(b)** For purposes of determining entitlement to the payment of a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), a calendar year which includes at least three months of coverage credited under the legislation of Korea shall be considered as a year of contributions under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md).





**ARTICLE 9** 
### Benefits under the Old Age Security Act

**1** If a person is entitled to the payment of an Old Age Security pension or a spouse’s allowance solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Article 8, the agency of Canada shall calculate the amount of the pension or the spouse’s allowance payable to that person in conformity with the provisions of the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) governing the payment of a partial pension or a spouse’s allowance, exclusively on the basis of the periods of residence in Canada which may be considered under that Act or are deemed as such under Article 6 and which have been completed on or after 1 January 1988.


**2** Paragraph 1 shall also apply to a person outside Canada who would be entitled to the payment of a pension in Canada but who has not resided in Canada for the minimum period required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada.


**3** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

**(a)** an Old Age Security pension shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only if that person’s periods of residence, totalized as provided in Article 8, are at least equal to the minimum period of residence in Canada required by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md) for entitlement to the payment of a pension outside Canada; and



**(b)** a spouse’s allowance and a guaranteed income supplement shall be paid to a person who is outside Canada only to the extent permitted by the [Old Age Security Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/O/O-9.md).





**ARTICLE 10** 
### Benefits under the Canada Pension Plan

If a person is entitled to the payment of a benefit under the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) solely through the application of the totalizing provisions of Article 8, the agency of Canada shall calculate the amount of benefit payable to that person in the following manner:

**(a)** the earnings-related portion of the benefit shall be determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md), exclusively on the basis of the pensionable earnings under that Plan; and



**(b)** the flat-rate portion of the benefit shall be determined by multiplying:

**(i)** the amount of the flat-rate portion of the benefit determined in conformity with the provisions of the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md)



by



**(ii)** the fraction which represents the ratio of the periods of contributions to the [Canada Pension Plan](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-8.md) in relation to the minimum qualifying period required under that Plan to establish entitlement to that benefit, but in no case shall that fraction exceed the value of one.
