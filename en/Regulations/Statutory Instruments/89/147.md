**(a)** it shall first determine the amount of the theoretical benefit which would be payable under the legislation of Dominica solely on the basis of the creditable periods completed under that legislation;



**(b)** it shall then multiply the theoretical benefit by the ratio that the creditable periods actually completed under the legislation of Dominica represent in relation to the minimum creditable period required under the legislation of Dominica for entitlement to the benefit in question.





**2** The proportional benefit calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 shall be the benefit payable by the competent institution of Dominica.
