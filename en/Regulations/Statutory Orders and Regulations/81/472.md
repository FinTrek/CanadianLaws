## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.

The approach surfaces, shown on Department of Transport Yellowknife Zoning Plan dated March 31, 1978, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 08-26 and 14-32 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 08,



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 26,

**(d)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 32,



consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to 50 feet measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of each strip 1,000 feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of each strip and 50,000 feet measured horizontally from the end of each strip, the outer ends of each imaginary horizontal line being 8,000 feet from each projected centre line.





**PART IV** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Department of Transport Yellowknife Zoning Plan dated March 31, 1978, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 30 feet above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 30 feet above the surface of the ground.



**PART V** 
## Description of the Strips

The strips, shown on Department of Transport Yellowknife Zoning Plan dated March 31, 1978, are described as follows:

**(a)** the strip associated with runway 08-26 is 1,000 feet in width, 500 feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 6,400 feet in length, 200 feet extending beyond each end of the runway; and



**(b)** the strip associated with runway 14-32 is 1,000 feet in width, 500 feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 8,400 feet in length, 200 feet extending beyond each end of the runway.





**PART VI** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Transport Yellowknife Zoning Plan dated March 31, 1978, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to seven feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line production of each strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface, an approach surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
