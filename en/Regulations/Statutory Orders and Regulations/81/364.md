----------

His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 635 and 730 of the [Canada Shipping Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-9.md), is pleased hereby to make the annexed Regulations prescribing practices and procedures to be followed by persons on board ships in respect of bridge-to-bridge VHF radiotelephones to ensure safe navigation, effective September 1, 1981.




## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the VHF Radiotelephone Practices and Procedures Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** In these Regulations,

***appropriate*** means, with respect to a VHF channel, the channel specified in notices to mariners or in any law of Canada or of any country other than Canada for use in a traffic zone, or part thereof, for vessel traffic management purposes; (*appropriée*)

***appropriate Seaway channel*** means the channel set out in section 63 of the Seaway Regulations for a control sector; (*voie appropriée à la voie maritime*)

***complement*** means the number of persons comprising the master and crew of a ship; (*effectif*)

***deck watch*** means that part of the complement that is required for the purpose of attending to the navigation or security of a ship; (*quart à la passerelle*)

- **(a)** described in notices to mariners or in any law of Canada or of any country other than Canada,
- **(b)** established for the purpose of regulating vessel traffic,
- **(c)** in which vessels are to use a VHF channel other than Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) for vessel traffic management purposes, and
- **(d)** in respect of which a continuous listening watch on Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) is maintained for ships by that traffic centre or by a coast station that can establish effective communications with a traffic centre without delay; (*zone de gestion du trafic*)

## Application


**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), these Regulations apply to every ship that is required by the Ship Station Radio Regulations to be fitted with a bridge-to-bridge VHF radio-telephone installation where it is located
	- **(a)** in the case of a ship other than a Canadian ship, within
		- **(i)** Canadian waters, or
		- **(ii)** fishing zones of Canada described in section 16 of the [Oceans Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2031.md) and prescribed in regulations made under paragraph 25(b) of that Act; and
	- **(b)** in the case of a Canadian ship, within any waters.

- **(2)** In the event of any inconsistency between these Regulations and the laws of a country other than Canada that are applicable to a Canadian ship within its territorial or internal waters or fishing zones, the laws of that country prevail to the extent of the inconsistency in respect of such a Canadian ship.

- **(3)** [Revoked, SOR/84-914, s. 1]
> SOR/84-914, s. 1; SOR/89-87, s. 2; SOR/99-215, s. 7.





## General


**4** Where, at any time, a radio transmission required to be made by these Regulations is prohibited by any other law or may cause a fire or an explosion, the transmission shall be made as soon as it is permitted by that law or is not likely to cause a fire or an explosion.



**5** 

- **(1)** The master or a person authorized by him to maintain a listening watch or to make a navigation safety call required by these Regulations shall be qualified in the use of the radiotelephone.

- **(2)** Where any person maintaining a listening watch or making a navigation safety call required by these Regulations is not in charge of the deck watch, he shall, as soon as possible, inform the person in charge of the deck watch of
	- **(a)** any information he receives, and
	- **(b)** any navigation safety call he makes
that is likely to affect the safe navigation of the ship.

- **(3)** Any person maintaining a listening watch or making a navigation safety call required by these Regulations shall do so in accordance with these Regulations.
> SOR/89-87, s. 3.




**6** Nothing in these Regulations shall be construed as
- **(a)** relieving a ship of its obligation to sound the appropriate whistle signals required by, or
- **(b)** permitting a ship to carry out manoeuvres that contravene the provisions of the steering and sailing Rules of,
the [Collision Regulations](/en/Regulations/Consolidated%20Regulations%20of%20Canada/1401-1500/C.R.C.,%20c.%201416.md) that apply in the area being navigated by the ship.



**7** The master and the person in charge of the deck watch shall ensure that these Regulations are complied with.




## Listening Watch


**8** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (3), on every ship a listening watch on a VHF radiotelephone receiver shall be maintained continuously during the period commencing 15 minutes before the ship is underway and terminating when the ship is
	- **(a)** securely anchored, moored or made fast to the shore or secured by any means to the bottom; and
	- **(b)** in a place where its presence does not constitute a hazard to passing ships.

- **(2)** A VHF radiotelephone receiver, referred to in subsection (1), on a ship described in Column I of an item of the schedule shall be set to the channel set out in Column II of that item and shall operate with sufficient gain to permit it to receive normal communications on that channel if other radio transmissions do not block out those communications by capture or override.

- **(2.1)** [Revoked, SOR/89-87, s. 4]

- **(3)** Where a ship is not fitted with an additional or built-in facility that permits continuous or sequential monitoring of Channel 16 (156.8 MHz), the listening watch required by subsection (1) may be interrupted for short periods while the radiotelephone installation is being used to transmit or receive communications on another channel authorized in the licence for that installation.
> SOR/86-94, s. 2; SOR/89-87, s. 4.





## Navigation Safety Call


**9**
