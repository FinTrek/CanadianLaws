## Precautions To Be Taken in Handling of Explosives Used for Marine Drilling and Blasting Operations
**1** Explosives other than detonators shall not be carried on a drill scow, but shall be stowed on an explosive storage craft specially adapted for the carriage and stowage of explosives.


**2** The explosives storage craft shall be moored securely to the drill scow in such a position that it will be remote from the drills and as far as possible from the navigable channel.


**3** The distance between the explosives storage craft and the drill scow shall be kept to a minimum to facilitate easy handling of the explosives and no person shall be on board the explosives storage craft until the explosives are actually required.


**4** The explosives storage craft shall be equipped with an efficient anchor and sufficient line for use in case of emergency.


**5** A large sign reading “EXPLOSIVES” or “EXPLOSIFS” shall be displayed in a conspicuous position on the explosives storage craft.


**6** Where work is discontinued for more than 24 hours, all explosives remaining on the explosives storage craft shall be removed ashore and placed in a magazine that meets the requirements of the [Explosives Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-17.md) and Regulations thereunder.


**7** No person shall smoke or use naked lights on any explosives storage craft.


**8** Smoking or the use of naked lights on a drill scow shall be limited to such areas and such times as are designated by the person in charge of the drill scow.


**9** Where ships carry explosives, efficient lightning conductors shall be fitted to wooden masts and to steel masts where electrical conductivity of the rigging is defective, but in steel ships, steel masts shall be bonded to the hull or lightning conductors fitted.


**10** Detonators shall be stowed on a drill scow in a locked box or cabinet remote from the drills.


**11** The armed charges, which shall be made ready only a few minutes before use, shall be stowed in a suitable receptacle on the drill scow.


**12** Two persons in each shift shall be detailed to handle the explosives, one to discharge the explosives from the explosives storage craft to the drill scow and one to arm the charges.


**13** The two persons responsible for the handling of the explosives shall also be responsible for the mooring lines between the drill scow and the explosives storage craft and shall pay special attention to the lines while ships are navigating in the vicinity.





## Transportation of Explosives on Tugs and Like Vessels

**14** Tugs and similar vessels used in transporting explosives to the explosives storage craft shall be operated as follows:
