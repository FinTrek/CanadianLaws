## Eligibility of Claimant to Receive an Award


**4** 

- **(1)** In order to be eligible to receive an award in respect of a claim, a claimant must have been a Canadian citizen from the time the claim arose or the time he obtained title to it until November 7, 1980 and, where a claimant obtained title to a claim after the time it arose, each of his predecessors in title must have been a Canadian citizen during the time he held title to it.

- **(2)** Where an eligible claimant within the meaning of subsection (1) who gave notice of his claim on or before November 7, 1980 dies after that date, an award may be made to any person lawfully entitled thereto irrespective of his nationality.

- **(3)** The eligibility of a corporation that is a Canadian citizen is limited to an amount that represents the same percentage to the total amount of its claim as does the Canadian beneficial ownership of the issued shares of the corporation to the total issued share capital of the corporation on either the date the claim arose or on November 7, 1980, whichever is the lesser.



**5** 

- **(1)** Where a claimant has been paid or, in the opinion of the Commission, is likely to be paid any compensation in respect of his claim from a source other than the Fund, the Commission shall deduct the amount of that compensation from the amount of the award it recommends be paid to that claimant out of the Fund.

- **(2)** Where a claimant by reason of his own neglect or default has failed to receive, has forfeited his right to receive or has lost his eligibility to receive any compensation in respect of his claim from a source other than the Fund, subsection (1) applies as if he had been paid that compensation.

- **(3)** Where a claimant who knew or ought to have known that if he failed to apply on or before a fixed date he would forfeit his right or lose his eligibility to receive any compensation in respect of his claim from a source other than the Fund fails to so apply, that failure shall, for the purposes of subsection (2), be considered to be neglect by the claimant.




## Report

- **(3)** The Chief Commissioner may make a report on any claim on the basis of the information then available to the Commission where, in his opinion, postponement of his report in respect of the claim would result in undue delay.
