----------

His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 6 of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), is pleased hereby to approve the annexed Regulations respecting Zoning at Fredericton Airport made by the Minister of Transport.




## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Fredericton Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means the Fredericton Airport, in the county of Sunbury, in the Province of New Brunswick; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the assigned elevation of the airport reference point is 53 feet above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, that consist of
- **(a)** the lands within, and
- **(b)** the lands directly under that portion of an approach surface that extends beyond
the outer limits described in Part II of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point, any
- **(a)** approach surface;
- **(b)** outer surface; or
- **(c)** transitional surface.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit that land or any part of it to be used for the disposal or accumulation of any waste, material or substance edible by or attractive to birds.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(ss. 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point is a point distant 500 feet measured southwesterly at right angles to the centre line of runway 15-33 and distant 500 feet measured northwesterly at right angles to the centre line of runway 09-27, the point having co-ordinate values of N. 769,959.37 feet and E. 991,257.19 feet with reference to the New Brunswick Horizontal Control System.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Outer Limits of Lands

The boundary of the outer limits of lands is a circular area having a radius of 13,000 feet the centre of which coincides with the airport reference point, except where any portion of C.F.B. Gagetown falls within the above described radius, the boundary of the outer limits of lands is the boundary of C.F.B. Gagetown as shown on Department of Public Works Plan No. S-352.



**PART III** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Department of Public Works Plans S-352, S-352A, S-352B and S-352C dated July 20, 1977 and prepared for the Department of Transport, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 09-27 and 15-33 and described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 09,



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 27,



**(c)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 15, and



**(d)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 33,



consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 foot measured vertically to 50 feet measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of each strip 1,000 feet measured vertically above the elevation at the end of each strip and 50,000 feet measured horizontally from the end of each strip, the outer ends of each imaginary horizontal line being 8,000 feet from each projected centre line.





**PART IV** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Department of Public Works Plan S-352 dated July 20, 1977 and prepared for the Department of Transport, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except where that common plane is less than 30 feet above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 30 feet above the surface of the ground.



**PART V** 
## Description of the Strips

The strips, shown on Department of Public Works Plan S-352 dated July 20, 1977 and prepared for the Department of Transport, are described as follows:

**(a)** the strip associated with runway 09-27 is 1,000 feet in width, 500 feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 7,400 feet in length, 200 feet extending beyond each end of the runway; and



**(b)** the strip associated with runway 15-33 is 1,000 feet in width, 500 feet being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 6,400 feet in length, 200 feet extending beyond each end of the runway.





**PART VI** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Public Works Plan S-352 dated July 20, 1977 and prepared for the Department of Transport, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one foot measured vertically to seven feet measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line production of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
