## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Norman Wells Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means Norman Wells Airport, in the vicinity of Norman Wells, in the Northwest Territories; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the assigned elevation of the airport reference point is deemed to be 72.54 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, that consist of
- **(a)** the lands within, and
- **(b)** the lands directly under that portion of an approach surface that extends beyond
the outer limits described in Part II of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point any
- **(a)** approach surface;
- **(b)** outer surface; or
- **(c)** transitional surface.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or the occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit such land or any part of it to be used for the disposal of any waste edible by or attractive to birds.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(s. 6)**

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point is a point determined by commencing at the point of intersection of the centre line of runway 08-26 with the westerly boundary of Lot 11, Group 1158, Plan 57303 (C.L.S.R.) 750 (L.T.O.), thence proceeding easterly along the said centre line of runway 08-26 a distance of 2 436.14 m.



**PART II** 
## Description of Outer Limits of Land

A circular area having a radius of 4 000 m, the centre of which is the airport reference point.



**PART III** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 08-26 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 08,



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 26,



consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip, and 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line.





**PART IV** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART V** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip, shown on Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562, is described as follows:

the strip associated with runway 08-26 is 300 m in width, 150 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 948.8 m in length.





**PART VI** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.
