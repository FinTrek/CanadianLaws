## Depreciation



### General


**48** In sections 49 to 57,

***group system*** means a system by which a weighted average rate of depreciation is calculated for a particular group of plant accounts, a plant account, or a group of assets within a plant account, and established in recognition of the fact that some part of the investment in a group of assets may be recovered through salvage realization and that there will be variations in the service lives of the assets constituting the group, even among assets of the same class; (*système de dépréciation en groupe*)

***service life*** means the period of time between the placement of plant in service and its retirement; (*vie utile*)

***service value*** means the book cost of plant minus the estimated net salvage value of that plant. (*valeur de service*)



**49** 

- **(1)** Under the group system, in the case of an ordinary retirement of an individual asset in a group of assets, the accumulated depreciation attributable to the asset shall, for the purposes of these Regulations, be considered to be equal to the cost of the asset minus any amount that may reasonably be recoverable through salvage realization, whether or not the actual service life of the asset is shorter or longer than the anticipated average service life for the group.

- **(2)** Assets, within a group of assets, remaining in use after reaching their average service life expectancy shall not be regarded as fully depreciated until actual retirement or until the group is fully depreciated, whichever is earlier.



**50** 

- **(1)** Charges for depreciation with respect to accounts that are classed by section 51 as being accounts covering assets that are depreciable shall be computed in conformity with the group system.
