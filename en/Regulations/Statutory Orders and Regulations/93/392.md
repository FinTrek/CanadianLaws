If, on the other hand, the Minister finds that the advance payment made to the lender in respect of the claims that have been accepted is more than the amount to which the lender was entitled in respect of those claims, the Minister shall notify the lender that the advance payment in respect of those claims was excessive and shall tell the lender why it was excessive.
