**6**

- **(5)** In a proceeding in respect of an application under subsection (1), the court may, on the motion of a second person, dismiss the application
	- **(a)** if the court is satisfied that the patents at issue are not eligible for inclusion on the register or are irrelevant to the dosage form, strength and route of administration of the drug for which the second person has filed a submission for a notice of compliance; or
	- **(b)** on the ground that the application is redundant, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious or is otherwise an abuse of process.

- **(6)** For the purposes of an application referred to in subsection (1), where a second person has made an allegation under subparagraph 5(1)(b)(iv) or (1.1)(b)(iv) in respect of a patent and where that patent was granted for the medicine itself when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents, it shall be considered that the drug proposed to be produced by the second person is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, prepared or produced by those methods or processes.

	- **(b)** the inclusion on the certified patent list of a patent that should not have been included under section 4; and
