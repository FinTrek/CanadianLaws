## Marine Mammal Disturbance



### Authorized Disturbance


**38** 

- **(1)** Despite sections 7 and 7.2, the Minister may authorize the disturbance of marine mammals if it is established that the activity causing the disturbance

	- **(b)** could improve a marine mammal’s immediate chance of survival;
	- **(c)** would contribute to the conservation and protection of marine mammals;
	- **(d)** could ease the pain and suffering of a marine mammal that is in distress;
	- **(e)** would contribute to marine scientific research; or
	- **(f)** would permit the production of audiovisual records of activities of marine mammals, which could facilitate a better understanding of marine mammals and thereby contribute to their conservation and protection.

- **(2)** The authorization may be subject to any condition respecting
	- **(a)** the waters in which marine mammals may be disturbed;
	- **(b)** the marine mammals that may be disturbed;
	- **(c)** the period during which marine mammals may be disturbed;
	- **(d)** the type, size, number and identification of vehicles that are permitted to be used and the persons who are permitted to operate them;
	- **(e)** the manner in which those vehicles are to be operated, including the distance they are required to maintain from marine mammals, their speed and direction and the requirement to avoid impeding the path of marine mammals;
	- **(f)** the manner in which marine mammals may be disturbed and the measures that are required to mitigate or minimize the negative effects of disturbing them;
	- **(g)** the diagnostic assessment or any other assessments that are to be carried out in respect of marine mammals before, during and after the disturbance;
	- **(h)** the information that must be reported to the Minister, as well as the method by which, the times at which and the person for whom the report is to be made; and
	- **(i)** the records that must be maintained with respect to the activity causing the disturbance as well as the manner and form in which the records are to be maintained, the times at which and the person for whom the records are to be produced and the period for which the records are to be retained.
