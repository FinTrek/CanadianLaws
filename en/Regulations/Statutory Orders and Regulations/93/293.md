Date registered: 8 June 1993

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 5.5(1)<sup><a href='#footnote1_e'>[*]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), a copy of proposed Regulations Respecting Zoning at Bagotville Airport was published in two successive issues of a newspaper serving the area to which the proposed Regulations relate, on May 27 and May 28, 1992, and in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I, on April 11 and April 18, 1992;

And Whereas a reasonable opportunity was thereby afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of National Defence with respect to the proposed Regulations;

And Whereas the purpose of the proposed Regulations is to prevent lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Bagotville Airport from being used or developed in a manner that is, in the opinion of the Minister of National Defence, incompatible with the safe operation of an airport or aircraft;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to paragraph 5.4(2)(b)<sup><a href='#footnote1_e'>[*]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), is pleased hereby to make the annexed Regulations Respecting Zoning at Bagotville Airport.
