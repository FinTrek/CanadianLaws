	- **(b)** the applicable label or marking fees are determined by adding the applicable existing fee to the product of that fee multiplied by the average percentage change year-over-year in the CPI and rounding the sum to the nearest $1.00.

- **(3)** Where the average percentage change year-over-year in the Consumer Price Index as calculated in subsection (1) is equal to or less than zero the fee remains the same.

- **(4)** Fees adjusted by the formula based upon the Consumer Price Index come into effect April 1st of each year after the notice of the fee adjustment and the manner in which it was determined is published in the Canada Gazette Part I.
