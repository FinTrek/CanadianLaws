## Purpose and Scope



**Purpose**

**2** 

- **(1)** These Regulations set out the information that a person must provide to the Minister of the Environment under subsection 81(1) of the Act before manufacturing or importing a chemical or polymer that is not on the DSL. The information is required so that the Minister may determine whether the chemical or polymer is toxic or capable of becoming toxic within the meaning of section 64 of the Act. These Regulations set out the periods within which the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health must assess the information received and the conditions under which the Minister of the Environment must add a chemical or polymer to the DSL under section 87 of the Act.

**Contents**

- **(2)** The Regulations are divided into 4 Parts: Parts 1 and 2 set out the information requirements; Part 3, administrative matters; Part 4, the obligations of the Ministers. Schedules 1 to 6 and 9 to 11 set out information to be provided, Schedule 7, the types of polymers, Schedule 8, reactants and Schedule 12, flowcharts giving an overview of all the information requirements.




**Avoiding regulatory duplication**

**3** 

- **(1)** For greater certainty, these Regulations do not apply in respect of a substance that is manufactured or imported for a use that is regulated under any other Act or regulations listed in Schedule 2 to the Act.

**Transit**

- **(2)** These Regulations also do not apply in respect of a substance that is loaded on a carrier outside Canada and moved through Canada to a location outside Canada, whether or not there is a change of carrier during transit.




**Maximum exempt quantities**

**4** For the purposes of paragraph 81(6)(e) of the Act, a substance is exempt from the application of subsection 81(1) of the Act if it is manufactured or imported in a quantity that does not exceed the quantity that first triggers a requirement to provide information under these Regulations.

### **SCHEDULE 12** 
**(Subsection 2(2))**
## Overview of Information Requirements
**1** The information required under the New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers) is divided into three flowcharts according to the type of substance:
- **(a)** research and development, contained site-limited intermediate and contained export-only substances — Flowchart 1;
- **(b)** chemicals and biochemicals other than research and development, contained site-limited intermediate and contained export-only substances — Flowchart 2; and
- **(c)** polymers and biopolymers other than research and development, contained site-limited intermediate and contained export-only substances — Flowchart 3.


**2** Choose the appropriate flowchart according to the type of substance. Each flowchart identifies the information to be provided and the quantity that triggers the regulatory obligation to provide it.


**3** References in the flowcharts are to provisions of the Regulations, in italics, and to schedules to the Regulations. Note that certain words and expressions used in the flowcharts are defined in section 1 of the Regulations.


**4** The shapes used in the flowcharts distinguish their contents as follows:
- **(a)** the ovals identify the type of substance referred to in the flowchart, as more particularly described in the flowchart’s title;
- **(b)** the diamonds identify the timeline and quantity trigger; and
- **(c)** the rectangles identify the required information.


**5** Shapes outlined with a broken line signal that information is required only in certain circumstances.


**6** Additional information is set out in footnotes to each flowchart.


**7** The Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health must assess the information within the same number of days as are afforded to the manufacturer or importer for provision of that information — see section 16 of the Regulations. For example, if a manufacturer or importer is required to provide information at least 30 days before the day on which a certain quantity is exceeded, then the Ministers must assess that information within 30 days after receiving it.
