<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: S.C. 2002, c. 22 <br />




## Grades and Specifications


**1** 

- **(1)** The specification for a grade of denatured alcohol set out in column 1 of Schedule 1 is the quantity of the denaturant set out in column 2 mixed with 100 L of spirits.

- **(2)** The specification for a grade of specially denatured alcohol set out in column 1 of Schedule 2 is the quantity of the denaturant set out in column 2 mixed with 100 L of spirits.

- **(3)** Where the volume of spirits to be denatured to a grade set out in column 1 of Schedule 1 or 2 is greater or less than 100 L, the quantity of denaturant used shall be in the same proportion to that volume of spirits that the quantity of the denaturant set out in column 2 of that Schedule is to 100 L.



**2** The composition of the denatured alcohol grades set out in Schedule 1 and the specially denatured alcohol grades set out in Schedule 2 is stated in terms of ethyl alcohol of a minimum strength of
- **(a)** 75% absolute ethyl alcohol by volume at 20°C in the case of grade DA-2J; and
- **(b)** 95% absolute ethyl alcohol by volume at 20°C in the case of all other grades.




## Manner of Denaturing


**3** A spirits licensee who denatures spirits shall ensure that
- **(a)** the spirits and the denaturants are thoroughly mixed; and
- **(b)** the denaturant used is a denaturant set out in column 1 of the table to this section that possesses the characteristics set out in column 2.
