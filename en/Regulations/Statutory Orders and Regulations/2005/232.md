----------

Whereas the Governor in Council is of the opinion that an extraordinary disruption to the effective continued operation of the national transportation system, other than a labour disruption, exists;

Whereas the Governor in Council, pursuant to section 47 of the [Canada Transportation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2010.md)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> may take any step that the Governor in Council considers essential to stabilize the national transportation system;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: S.C. 1996, c. 10<br />

Whereas the Governor in Council is of the opinion that a failure to act under section 47 of the [Canada Transportation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2010.md)<sup>[a]</sup> at this time would be contrary to the interests of users and operators of the national transportation system and that there are no other provisions in that Act or in any other Act of Parliament that are sufficient and appropriate to remedy the situation and counter the anticipated damage that would be caused by the ongoing extraordinary disruption of the national transportation system;

And whereas the Governor in Council considers it essential that, to stabilize the national transportation system, an authorization be granted to a facilitator, truckers, shippers, brokers, ports and the representatives of those persons and any other persons whose agreement, consent, participation or co-operation is required to resolve the dispute and implement any element of the proposed solution, including for greater certainty and if applicable, a public officer, on the terms and conditions prescribed in the annexed Order;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Industry in his capacity as the minister responsible for the Competition Bureau, pursuant to section 47 of the [Canada Transportation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2010.md)<sup>[a]</sup>, hereby makes the annexed Order Authorizing Negotiations for the Settlement of the Dispute Causing the Extraordinary Disruption of the National Transportation System in Relation to Container Movements into and out of Certain Ports in British Columbia.
