[**77** to **79** reserved]



## Daily Logs



### Interpretation


**80** A requirement that a driver record time in a daily log is a requirement to record the time using the local time at the driver’s home terminal.




### Requirement to Fill Out a Daily Log


**81** 

- **(1)** A motor carrier shall require every driver to fill out and every driver shall fill out a daily log each day that accounts for all of the driver’s on-duty time and off-duty time for that day.

- **(2)** This section does not apply if
	- **(a)** the driver operates or is instructed by the motor carrier to operate a commercial vehicle within a radius of 160 km of the home terminal;
	- **(b)** the driver returns to the home terminal each day to begin a minimum of 8 consecutive hours of off-duty time;
	- **(c)** the motor carrier maintains accurate and legible records showing, for each day, the driver’s duty status and elected cycle, the hour at which each duty status begins and ends and the total number of hours spent in each status and keeps those records for a minimum period of 6 months after the day on which they were recorded; and
	- **(d)** the driver is not driving under a permit issued under these Regulations.




### Content of Daily Logs

- **(1)** At the beginning of each day, a motor carrier shall require that a driver enters legibly and the driver shall enter legibly the following information in the daily log:
	- **(a)** the date, the start time if different than midnight, the name of the driver and, if the driver is a member of a team of drivers, the names of the co-drivers;
	- **(b)** in the case of a driver who is not driving under the provisions of an oil well service permit, the cycle that the driver is following;
	- **(c)** the commercial vehicle licence plates or unit numbers;
	- **(d)** the odometer reading of each of the commercial vehicles operated by the driver;
	- **(e)** the names and the addresses of the home terminal and the principal place of business of every motor carrier by whom the driver was employed or otherwise engaged during that day;
	- **(f)** in the “Remarks” section of the daily log, if the motor carrier or driver was not required to keep a daily log immediately before the beginning of the day, the number of hours of off-duty time and on-duty time that were accumulated by the driver each day during the 14 days immediately before the beginning of the day; and
	- **(g)** if applicable, a declaration in the “Remarks” section of the daily log that states that the driver is deferring off-duty time under section 16 and that clearly indicates whether the driver is driving under day one or day two of that time.

- **(2)** The motor carrier shall require that the driver records and the driver shall record in the daily log the hours in each duty status during the day covered by the daily log, in accordance with Schedule 2, and the location of the driver each time their duty status changes, as that information becomes known.

- **(3)** At the end of each day, the motor carrier shall require that the driver records and the driver shall record the total hours for each duty status and the total distance driven by the driver that day, excluding the distance driven in respect of the driver’s personal use of the vehicle, as well as the odometer reading at the end of the day and sign the daily log attesting to the accuracy of the information recorded in it.
