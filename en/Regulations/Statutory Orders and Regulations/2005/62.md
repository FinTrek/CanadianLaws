**Provincial submission**

- **(2)** The agreement shall provide that any proposal by the province, that is intended to take effect in the following year, for the introduction of an insurance plan for a new agricultural product, or for a change to an insurance program or insurance plan, that has a financial impact shall be submitted by the responsible officer of the province to the Minister, in writing, with complete operational details and an estimate of the financial impact at least 60 days before the proposed date of implementation, unless otherwise agreed to by Canada and the province.

### Coverage Levels



**Maximum coverage levels**

**3** A production insurance agreement shall provide that the manner of determining the percentage of the value of production of an agricultural product that may be insured, as set out in the agreement, shall be subject to the following maximum level:
- **(a)** 90% of the probable yield for insurance plans based on yield;
- **(b)** 90% of the value of production for insurance plans not based on yield if production of the agricultural product is reduced by weather or other agricultural perils; and
- **(c)** for all other insurance plans not based on yield, as covered under section 15, 100% of the value of production minus the long-term average loss percentage for the agricultural product or 90% of the value of production if the long-term average loss percentage cannot be determined.




### Determination of Losses



**Insured perils**

**4** 

- **(1)** A production insurance agreement shall provide that all insurance contracts to which the agreement applies, except those covering losses specified in paragraph 15(c), shall provide insurance against more than one of the perils specified in the agreement.

**Determination of losses**

- **(2)** The agreement shall provide that losses of a farm enterprise, with the exception of the losses referred to in section 15, shall be determined by subtracting the total production of an agricultural product, adjusted for any quality losses, from the total production guarantee for the agricultural product on all exposure units of the farm enterprise.

**Agricultural products to be distinguishable**

- **(3)** The agreement shall provide that, for the losses in respect of an agricultural product to be determined separately under an insurance plan, the agricultural product shall meet the following criteria:
	- **(a)** the agricultural product can be distinguished from other like agricultural products;
	- **(b)** the agricultural product has a separate market price from other like agricultural products;
	- **(c)** the agricultural product has different productive capabilities or production risks from other like agricultural products; and
	- **(d)** there is sufficient volume of production and availability of data to ensure the financial viability of an insurance plan related to the agricultural product.

**Exception**

- **(4)** The agreement shall provide that any insurance coverage benefit under an insurance contract that is an exception to subsections (1) to (3) is deemed to be a risk-splitting benefit.

**Level of premium support**

- **(5)** The agreement shall provide that the risk-splitting benefit shall be subject to the level of premium support from Canada that is associated with high-cost production coverage, as set out in the agreement, and shall be supported as being feasible by documentation showing that the following conditions are met:
	- **(a)** standards and procedures for adjusting losses are in place;
	- **(b)** administrative resources agreed to as adequate by the parties to the agreement are available;
	- **(c)** administrative costs associated with the risk-splitting benefit are reported separately from the other administrative costs associated with insurance plans; and
	- **(d)** sufficient volume of production and data are available to ensure the financial viability of the risk-splitting benefits.

**No double indemnity**

- **(6)** The agreement shall provide that if there is a risk-splitting benefit under an insurance contract, there shall be loss adjustment and payment processes to ensure that damage is paid for only once or that any indemnity payable under a risk-splitting benefit is deducted from any other indemnities payable under an insurance contract.




**Risk-splitting benefit**

**5** A production insurance agreement entered into with a province shall provide that a risk-splitting benefit may be subject to the level of premium support from Canada that is associated with comprehensive production coverage, as set out in the agreement, if one of the following conditions is met:
- **(a)** the province can prove that the risk-splitting benefits arise from third-party intervention;
- **(b)** the province demonstrates, by a statistical analysis, that operating a risk-splitting benefit results in indemnity payments that are less than would otherwise be paid under the insurance plan; or
- **(c)** the total costs of the risk-splitting benefit are less than the total costs for the same perils and coverage level under an insurance plan that does not provide risk-splitting benefits.
