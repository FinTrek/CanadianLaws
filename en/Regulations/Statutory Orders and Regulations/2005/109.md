- **(1)** The following definitions apply in these Regulations.

***container*** means a receptacle or package in which a surface coating material is offered for sale. It does not include a receptacle or package that is not customarily displayed to the public, such as a package liner, any outer wrapping or box or a shipping container.

***display panel*** means any part of a container on which the identity of the product is displayed in terms of its common or generic name or in terms of its function.

***display panel area***[Repealed, SOR/2007-230, s. 1]

***good laboratory practices*** means practices that are in accordance with the principles set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s document entitled OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice, Number 1 of the OECD Series on Principles of Good Laboratory Practice and Compliance Monitoring, ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17, the English version of which is dated January 21, 1998 and the French version of which is dated March 6, 1998.

***surface coating material*** means a paint or other similar material that dries to a solid film when a layer of it is applied to a surface. It does not include a material that becomes a part of the substrate.

**Calculation of display panel area**

- **(2)** In calculating the area of a display panel for the purposes of these Regulations, any seam and any convex or concave surface at the top or bottom of the container are to be excluded.

**Exception – curved containers**

- **(3)** In the case of a container that is curved in any way, other than a bag, the display panel area is to be calculated as 40% of the total area of the container, excluding the top and bottom.

**Determination of minimum height of type**

- **(2)** The minimum height of the type referred to in subsection (1) is determined by measuring an upper-case letter or a lower-case letter that has an ascender or descender, such as “b” or “p”.




## Requirements



### Lead



**Concentration and test method criteria**

**4** 

- **(1)** The concentration of total lead present in a surface coating material must not be more than 600 mg/kg when a dried sample of it is tested in accordance with a method that conforms to good laboratory practices.

**Exceptions**

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply to a surface coating material that is used
	- **(a)** as an anti-corrosive or an anti-weathering coating applied on the interior or exterior surface of any building or equipment that is used for an agricultural or industrial purpose;
	- **(b)** as an anti-corrosive or an anti-weathering coating applied on any structure, other than a building, that is used for an agricultural, industrial or public purpose;
	- **(c)** as a touch-up coating for metal surfaces;
