Whereas the Canadian Public Affairs Channel (CPAC) is a valuable and unique component of the broadcasting system;

Whereas the Standing Committee on Official Languages and the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage have recommended that CPAC be made more widely available in both official languages;

Whereas direct-to-home distribution undertakings are required to provide CPAC in both official languages;

Whereas the Government of Canada is of the opinion that every effort should be made to ensure that CPAC be made available in both official languages to more cable subscribers;

Whereas cable broadcasting distribution undertakings who have fewer than 2,000 subscribers may suffer significant financial or competitive difficulties if they are required to distribute CPAC in both official languages;

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 26(4) of the [Broadcasting Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2011.md)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup>, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has consulted with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission with regard to the annexed Direction to the CRTC (Reservation of Channels for the Distribution of CPAC);
