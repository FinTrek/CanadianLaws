	- **(a)** if the total quantity of the pharmaceutical product that is authorized to be manufactured and exported is exported in a single shipment, the amount of the royalty determined in accordance with subsection (4) or (6), as the circumstances require, shall be paid in full within 45 days after the date of the export notice provided under section 21.07 of the Act; and

- **(5)** If the name of the country or WTO Member to which an authorization relates does not appear on the Index, the rate for calculating the royalty that is required to be paid to the patentee or to each of the patentees, as the case may be, in respect of the applicable authorization shall be determined by
	- **(a)** adding 1 to the total number of countries listed on the Index;
	- **(b)** subtracting from the sum determined under paragraph (a) the average
		- **(i)** in the case of a country or WTO Member to which the pharmaceutical product is to be exported and whose name appears in Schedule 2 or 3 to the Act, of the numerical ranks on the Index of all of the countries and WTO Members whose names appear both on the Index and in the same Schedule to the Act as the country or WTO Member to which the pharmaceutical product is to be exported,
		- **(ii)** in the case of a country — other than a WTO Member — to which the pharmaceutical product is to be exported and whose name appears in Schedule 4 to the Act, of the numerical ranks on the Index of all of the WTO Members whose names appear both on the Index and in Schedule 3 to the Act, and
		- **(iii)** in the case of a WTO Member to which the pharmaceutical product is to be exported and whose name appears in Schedule 4 to the Act, of the numerical ranks on the Index of all of the WTO Members whose names appear both on the Index and in Schedule 4 to the Act;

	- **(b)** when there is more than one patentee, by dividing the amount determined under paragraph (a) by the number of patentees.
