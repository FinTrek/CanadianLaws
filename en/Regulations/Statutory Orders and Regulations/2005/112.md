## Status of the Organization

**2** The Organization will have the legal capacities of a body corporate under Canadian domestic law, without prejudice to the privileges and immunities provided in this Arrangement, and the Head of Secretariat will be its legal representative with respect to the functions described in the Programme Agreement.


**3** The Organization, its property and assets, wherever located in Canada and by whomsoever held, will enjoy immunity from every form of legal process in Canada except in so far as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity. It is, however, understood that no waiver of immunity will extend to any measure of execution except with the express consent of the Organization.


**4** (a) The premises of the Organization's Headquarters will be inviolable. Representatives of the Canadian competent authorities will not enter the premises of the Organization except with the consent of the Head of Secretariat or the person authorized by the Head of Secretariat. However, this consent is presumed to be given in the event of fire or an emergency situation in the premises that creates a direct and serious threat to the life and security of persons.

**6** The Organization, its assets, income and other property in Canada will be:
- **(a)** exempt from all direct taxes; it is understood, however, that the Organization will not claim exemption from taxes which are, in fact, no more than charges for public utility services;
- **(b)** exempt from customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports in respect of articles imported or exported by the Organization for its official use; it is understood, however, that articles imported under such exemption will not be sold or disposed of in Canada except under conditions agreed with the Government of Canada;
- **(c)** exempt from all import, export and sales prohibitions and restrictions, and from customs duties and excise, with respect to its publications, including audio-visual material.


**7** While the Organization will not, as a general rule, claim exemption from excise duties and from taxes on the sale of movable and immovable property which form part of the price to be paid, nevertheless when the Organization is making important purchases for official use of property on which such duties and taxes have been charged or are chargeable, the Organization will, whenever possible, make appropriate administrative arrangements for the remission or return of the amount of duty or tax.



## Facilities in Respect of Communications

**8** The Organization will enjoy in Canada for its official communications treatment not less favourable than that accorded by the Government of Canada to any other Government in the matter of priorities, rates and taxes on mails, cables, telegrams, radiograms, telephotos, teletype and facsimile machines, telephones and other means of telecommunications; and press rates for information to the press and radio. No censorship will be applied to the official correspondence and other official communications of the Organization.


**9** The Organization will have the right to use codes and cipher and to despatch and receive its correspondence by courier or in bags, which will have the same immunities and privileges as diplomatic couriers and bags.



## Representatives of Member States

**10** Representatives of Member States to meetings and conferences convened by the Organization will enjoy the following privileges and immunities within Canada, while exercising their functions and during their journey to and from the place of meeting:
- **(a)** immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage, and, in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in their capacity as representatives, immunity from legal process of every kind;
- **(b)** inviolability for all papers and documents;
- **(c)** the right to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags;
- **(d)** exemption in respect of themselves and their spouses from immigration restrictions, aliens registration or national service obligations in Canada;
- **(e)** the same immunities and facilities in respect of their personal baggage as are accorded to diplomatic envoys; and also,
- **(f)** such other privileges, immunities and facilities not inconsistent with the foregoing as diplomatic envoys enjoy, except that they shall have no right to claim exemption from customs duties on goods imported (otherwise than as part of their personal baggage) or from excise duties or sales taxes.


**11** In order to secure within Canada, for the Representatives of Member States to meetings and conferences convened by the Organization, complete freedom of speech and independence in the discharge of their duties, the immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in discharging their duties will continue to be accorded, notwithstanding that the persons concerned are no longer Representatives of Member States.


**12** Privileges and immunities within Canada are accorded to the Representatives of Member States not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization. Consequently, a Member State should waive the immunity of its representative in any case where in the opinion of the Member State the immunity would impede the course of justice, and it can be waived without prejudice to the purpose for which the immunity is accorded.

**14** In addition to the immunities and privileges specified in paragraph 13, the Head of Secretariat will be accorded, within Canada, in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse and minor children, the privileges and immunities, exemptions and facilities accorded to diplomatic envoys, in accordance with international law.


**15** Privileges and immunities are granted within Canada to Officials in the interests of the Organization and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves. The Head of Secretariat should waive the immunity of any Official in any case where, in his or her opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the Organization. In the case of the Head of Secretariat, the Council will have the right to waive immunity.



## Experts on Missions for the Organization

- **(a)** immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage;
- **(b)** in respect of words spoken or written and acts done by them in the course of the performance of their mission, immunity from legal process of every kind.

- **(d)** for the purpose of their communications with the Organization, the right to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags;

The Head of Secretariat, in consultation with Member States, should waive the immunity of any expert in any case where, in his or her opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and it can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the Organization.



## Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents

**18** Nothing in this Arrangement exempts a Canadian citizen or permanent resident from liability for any taxes or duties imposed by any law in Canada.



## Abuse of Privileges

**19** If the Government of Canada considers that an abuse of a privilege or immunity described in this Arrangement has occurred, consultation will take place between the Government of Canada and the Organization in order to determine whether such an abuse has occurred, and, if so, to endeavour to prevent its repetition.


**20** The Organization will cooperate at all times with the appropriate Canadian authorities to facilitate the proper administration of justice, to secure observance of police regulations and prevent the occurrence of any abuse of the privileges and immunities and facilities referred to in this Arrangement.



## Notification Procedure
