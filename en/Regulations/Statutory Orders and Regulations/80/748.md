	- **(ii)** the location of the travelled portion of the highway and of the highway right-of-way for at least 100 m in each direction from the crossing,
	- **(iii)** the width of the railway right-of-way,
	- **(iv)** the width of the highway right-of-way,
	- **(v)** the width of the travelled portion of the highway,
	- **(vi)** the width of the highway shoulders,
	- **(vii)** the angle of the crossing,
	- **(viii)** the location of all railway crossing signs and warning devices pertaining to the crossing,
	- **(ix)** sight lines and all obstructions to view within the distances referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), and
	- **(x)** drainage and utilities relating to the crossing and other information relevant to the construction of the crossing;
- **(b)** a profile of the railway, drawn to a scale of not less than 1:5000 horizontally and of not less than 1:250 vertically, for at least 400 m in each direction from the crossing, showing

## Crossing Surface


**6** 

- **(1)** Unless otherwise ordered by the Committee, when a crossing other than a pedestrian crossing is constructed, the crossing surface shall be in accordance with the diagrams set out in Schedule I and shall have a width of
	- **(a)** 8 m, or

## Crossing Approaches


**8** At all crossings the gradient of the approaches of the highway shall not be greater than 1 m of rise or fall for every 20 m of the horizontal length of the approaches.
