tax under subsection 165(2) or section 218.1 of the Act or Division IV.1 of Part IX of the Act in respect of the supply made under the varied or altered agreement or made under any of the new agreements shall be calculated at the rate at which tax would have been calculated under paragraph (d) on any part of the value of the consideration, referred to in paragraph (e), attributable to any part of the property or service.
