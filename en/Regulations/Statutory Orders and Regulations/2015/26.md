## Overview



**Purpose**

**2** These Regulations establish the minimum requirements with respect to the safety management system that a company must develop and implement for the purpose of achieving the highest level of safety in its railway operations.




**Organization — Parts**

**3** 

- **(1)** These Regulations are divided into three Parts:
	- **(a)** Part 1 sets out the requirements applicable to a railway company with respect to its safety management system and with respect to record-keeping, notification and filing of information;
	- **(b)** Part 2 sets out
		- **(i)** in Division 1, the requirements applicable to a local railway company that operates railway equipment on main track with respect to its safety management system and with respect to record-keeping, notification and filing of information, and
		- **(ii)** in Division 2, the requirements applicable to a local railway company that operates railway equipment exclusively on non-main track with respect to its safety management system and with respect to record-keeping, notification and filing of information; and
	- **(c)** Part 3 makes consequential amendments to the [Railway Operating Certificate Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2014/258.md), repeals the [Railway Safety Management System Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2001/37.md) and sets out the date on which these Regulations come into force.

**Organization — processes**

- **(2)** The safety management system requirements set out in Parts 1 and 2 are organized into key processes that group together related requirements, including, in most instances, the requirement that a company develop and implement
	- **(a)** procedures that establish a step-by-step sequence of activities for dealing with certain matters;
	- **(b)** methods that are not necessarily a step-by-step sequence of activities, but that establish the manner in which certain evaluation, verification or supervisory activities are to be carried out; or
	- **(c)** plans that establish the proposed time for carrying out certain activities with respect to the consultation and knowledge management requirements, and the proposed manner in which those activities are to be carried out.
