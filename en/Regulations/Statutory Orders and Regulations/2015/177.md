**Feces and unconsumed feed**

- **(2)** In the case of an aquaculture facility that cultivates finfish and that is operated under an aquaculture licence that permits a standing biomass of more than 2.5 t or an annual production of more than 5 t, the owner or operator of the facility must take reasonable measures to minimize the deposit of fish feces and unconsumed feed, having regard to the factors set out in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c).




**Information required before depositing**

**8** 

- **(1)** In the case of an aquaculture facility located in tidal waters for the cultivation of finfish that commences operations after the day on which these Regulations come into force, the owner or operator of the facility must submit the following information to the Minister at least 300 days before making a first deposit of a deleterious substance in the operation of the facility:
	- **(a)** the predicted contours of the footprint of the biochemical oxygen demanding matter that will be deposited by the facility, calculated in accordance with the Monitoring Standard;
