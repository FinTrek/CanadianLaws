## Conditions



**Permitted purposes**

**3** 

- **(1)** The exemption applies only if, in the case of an exemption from the application of subsection 4(4) of the Act, the jammer is installed, used, possessed, manufactured or imported or, in the case of an exemption from the application of paragraph 9(1)(b) of the Act, the radiocommunication is interfered with or obstructed, for any of the following purposes:
