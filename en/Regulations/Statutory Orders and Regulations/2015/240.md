**Obligation to carry out request**

**4** 

- **(1)** Except as otherwise provided under these Regulations or in a condition of its licence, a licensee that receives a request referred to in section 3 must carry out the requested deletion and substitution if the following conditions are met:

**Late request**

- **(2)** In the case of a request that is not received within the period referred to in paragraph (1)(a) but that meets the conditions set out in paragraphs (1)(b) to (d), the licensee may carry out the requested deletion and substitution, except as otherwise provided under these Regulations or in a condition of its licence.

**Decision by Commission**

- **(3)** A licensee must not delete a programming service and substitute another programming service for it if the Commission decides under subsection 18(3) of the [Broadcasting Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1991/c.%2011.md) that the deletion and substitution are not in the public interest.

**Minimal disruption**

**5** 

- **(1)** A licensee that deletes a programming service and substitutes another programming service for it must exercise due diligence to ensure that the deletion and substitution do not result in errors in the provision of the service and that they cause only minimal disruption of the service to its subscribers.
