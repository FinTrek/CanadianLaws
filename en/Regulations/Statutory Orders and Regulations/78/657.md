----------

His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 6 of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), is pleased hereby to approve the annexed Zoning Regulations respecting Sept-Iles Airport, made by the Minister of Transport.




## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Sept-Iles Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means Sept-Iles Airport, in the Township of Letellier, in the Province of Quebec; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point determined in the manner set out in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a strip along and at right angles to the projected centre line thereof, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule; (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** In these Regulations,
	- **(a)** coordinates and azimuths are of the M.T.M. System in which the central meridian of the zone is 67°30′; and
	- **(b)** distances are expressed in the metric system.



**3** For the purposes of these Regulations, the airport reference point is deemed to be 51.77 metres above sea level.




## Application


**4** These Regulations apply to all the lands and lands under water, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, the outer limits of which lands are described in Part II of the schedule, other than such lands as from time to time form part of the airport.




## General


**5** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point any of the surfaces hereinafter set out that project immediately over and above the surface of the land at that location, namely,
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surface.




## Natural Growth


**6** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in section 5, the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.

Being a surface abutting each end of the strips associated with runways 06-24, 10-28 and 14-32 and more particularly described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runways 10-28 and 14-32 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) metre measured vertically to fifty (50) metres measured horizontally and having:

**(i)** the outer ends 14 and 28 rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, 60.96 metres measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and 3 047.90 metres measured horizontally from the end of strip 14 and 3 047.95 metres measured horizontally from the end of strip 28, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 609.6 metres from the projected centre line of the strip, and



**(ii)** the outer ends 10 and 32 rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, 304.8 metres measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and 15 239.25 metres measured horizontally from the end of strip 10 and 15 239.76 metres measured horizontally from the end of strip 32, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 438.28 metres from the projected centre line of strip 10 and 2 438.25 metres from the projected centre line of strip 32, and





**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway 06-24 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of one (1) metre measured vertically to forty (40) metres measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip, 76.2 metres measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and 3 047.90 metres measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 381.0 metres from the projected centre line of the strip,



which approach surfaces are shown on Department of Public Works Plan No. M-77-4400, dated the 7th day of March, 1978.





**PART IV**

**(a)** a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45.72 metres above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, and



**(b)** where the common plane described in paragraph (a) is less than 9.144 metres above the surface of the ground, an imaginary surface located 9.144 metres above the surface of the ground,



which outer surface is shown on Department of Public Works Plan No. M-77-4400, dated the 7th day of March, 1978.
