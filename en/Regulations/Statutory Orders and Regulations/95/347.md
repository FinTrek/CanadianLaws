## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means the Tuktoyaktuk Airport, in the vicinity of Tuktoyaktuk, in the Northwest Territories; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de référence de l’aéroport*)

***approach surfaces*** means the imaginary inclined planes that extend upward and outward from each end of a strip, which planes are more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surfaces d’approche*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary plane located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which plane is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surfaceextérieure*)

***strip*** means a rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, that is prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which rectangular portion is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surfaces*** means the imaginary inclined planes that extend upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and the approach surfaces, which planes are more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surfaces de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 2.7 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all land, including public road allowances, that is adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which land is more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.




## Building Restrictions


**4** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, a building, structure or object or an addition to an existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, shown on Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029, dated April 14, 1994, is a point located on the centre line of runway 09-27 distant 702 m from the displaced threshold of runway 09.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029, dated April 14, 1994, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 09-27 and are described as follows:

**(a)** an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 09 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 27 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally, rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029, dated April 14, 1994, is an imaginary plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point extending to the outer boundary described in Part VI, except that, where that plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 09-27, shown on Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029, dated April 14, 1994, is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 524 m in length.



**PART V** 
## Description of the Transitional Surfaces

Each transitional surface, shown on Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029, dated April 14, 1994, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Land to Which These Regulations Apply

The outer boundary of the land to which these Regulations apply, shown on Tuktoyaktuk Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3029, dated April 14, 1994, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
