## Adapted Provisions


**4** For the purposes of section 9 of the [Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1990/c.%204.md),
- **(a)** in subparagraphs 10(9)(b)(i) and (ii) of the [Public Service Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-36.md), the year in which a person ceased to be employed in the Public Service is the year in which the person ceased to be employed by Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be;
- **(b)** in subsections 12(1) to (3) and (6) to (8) and section 13 of the [Public Service Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-36.md)
	- **(i)** the number of years of pensionable service and the number of years of service of an employee of Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be, includes any period of service with Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be, during the period beginning on the day following the date on which shares of Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be, are first sold or otherwise disposed of and ending on the day preceding the day on which the person ceases to be employed by Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be, and
	- **(ii)** the day on which a person ceases to be employed in the Public Service is the day on which that person ceases to be employed by Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be; and
- **(c)** in subsection 69(3) of the [Public Service Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-36.md), the retirement year or retirement month of a person who is an employee of Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be, is the year or month, as the case may be, in which the shares of Nordion or Theratronics, as the case may be, are first sold or otherwise disposed of.



**5** An option under section 12 or 13 of the [Public Service Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-36.md) exercised by an employee of Nordion shall be deemed to be null and void and the benefits to which that employee is entitled under that Act and the regulations made pursuant to that Act shall be determined as if sections 2 to 4 of these Regulations applied, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to that employee on the day on which that employee made that option, where the employee is a person who
- **(a)** meets the criteria set out in paragraphs 9(1)(a) and (d) of the [Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1990/c.%204.md);

## Coming into Force


**6** These Regulations shall be deemed to have come into force on November 9, 1991.
