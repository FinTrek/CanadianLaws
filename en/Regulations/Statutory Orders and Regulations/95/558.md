**SOR/95-558**

Enabling authorities: 
- [AERONAUTICS ACT](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md)

Date registered: 28 November 1995

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 5.5(1)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), a copy of the proposed Regulations respecting zoning at Greenwood Airport was published in two successive issues of the Kentville Adviser on May 9 and 16, 1995 and in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I on April 23 and 30, 1994;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1<br />

Whereas a reasonable opportunity was afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of National Defence with respect to the proposed Regulations;

And Whereas the proposed Regulations are for the purpose of preventing lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Greenwood Airport from being used or developed in a manner that is, in the opinion of the Minister of National Defence, incompatible with the safe operation of an airport or aircraft;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to paragraph 5.4(2)(b)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), is pleased hereby to make the annexed Regulations respecting zoning at Greenwood Airport.
