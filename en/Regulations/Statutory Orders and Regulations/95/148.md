- **(2)** Where publication referred to in subsection 7(2) of these Regulations sets out more than one maximum load rating for a tire of a particular size designation and type, the required maximum load rating shall not be less than the lowest of the maximum load ratings set out in the publication.



### Tread Wear Indicators

**2** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (3), every tire that has a rim diameter of 304.8 mm (12 in.) or more shall incorporate at least six treadwear indicators, spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the tire, in such a manner that the indicators will provide visible indication where the tire has worn to a tread depth of 1.6 mm (1/16 in.).

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), every tire that has a rim diameter of less than 304.8 mm (12 in.) shall incorporate at least three treadwear indicators, spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the tire, in such a manner that the indicators will provide visible indication where the tire has worn to a tread depth of 1.6 mm (1/16 in.).

- **(3)** Every motorcycle tire shall incorporate at least three treadwear indicators, spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the tire, in such a manner that the indicators will provide visible indication where the tire has worn to a tread depth of 0.8 mm (1/32 in.).



### Rules Respecting Testing

**3** For the purpose of testing, in accordance with subsections 5(2), 6(2) and 7(2), the strength, endurance and high speed performance of a tire, a new tire shall be used for each test.


**4** Before being subjected to the tire endurance test set out in subsection 6(2) or the high speed performance test set out in subsection 7(2), a tire of a particular size designation and type shall have no visible evidence of tread separation, sidewall separation, ply separation, cord separation, innerliner separation, bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking or open splices.



### Tire Strength

**5** 

- **(1)** Where a tire is tested for strength in accordance with subsection (2), the tire shall meet the applicable minimum static breaking energy values set out in Table I.

- **(2)** The strength of a tire shall be tested by
	- **(a)** mounting the tire on a test rim and inflating it to the inflation pressure corresponding to the maximum single load as moulded onto or into the tire or, where both a maximum dual load and a maximum single load are marked on the tire, corresponding to the maximum dual load so marked;
	- **(b)** conditioning the assembled tire and rim at room temperature for at least three hours and then adjusting the inflation pressure of the conditioned tire to the tire inflation pressure referred to in paragraph (a);
	- **(c)** forcing, at a rate of 50.8 mm/min (2 in./min) perpendicularly into a test point located on a tread rib of the tire that is as near to the centreline of the tread as possible, a cylindrical steel plunger that has a hemispherical end and has a diameter specified in Table I for that class of tire;
	- **(d)** recording the force that was applied to the cylindrical steel plunger and the distance it moved from the point at which the pressure was applied to the point it reached either immediately before puncturing the tire or immediately before reaching the rim if the tire was not punctured,
		- **(i)** at five test points equally spaced around the circumference of the tire, where the tire is designed to fit a rim having a diameter greater than 304.8 mm (12 in.), or
		- **(ii)** at three test points equally spaced around the circumference of the tire, where the tire is designed to fit a rim having a diameter of 304.8 mm (12 in.) or less;
	- **(e)** computing the static breaking energy values at each test point at which the cylindrical steel plunger was forced into the tread rib by using the force and distance values recorded pursuant to paragraph (d) in the formula
```
W = (F × D ) ÷ (2 )
```
where
- **W** is the static breaking energy, expressed in joules (inch-pounds),
- **F** is the force, expressed in newtons (pounds), and
- **D** is the distance, expressed in metres (inches); and
	- **(f)** determining the static breaking energy value for the tire by computing the average of the values obtained pursuant to paragraph (e).



### Tire Endurance

**6** 

- **(1)** Where a tire is tested for endurance in accordance with subsection (2), the tire shall
	- **(a)** at the end of the test, have
		- **(i)** no visible evidence of tread separation, sidewall separation, ply separation, cord separation, innerliner separation, bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking or open splices, and
		- **(ii)** a tire inflation pressure that is not less than the tire inflation pressure at the beginning of the test; and
	- **(b)** meet the applicable requirements for endurance set out in subsection (2) where tested on a test wheel either alone or simultaneously with up to five other tires.

- **(2)** The tire endurance test shall be performed by
	- **(a)** mounting the tire on a test rim and inflating it to the inflation pressure corresponding to the maximum single load rating as marked on the sidewall;
	- **(b)** conditioning the assembled tire and rim at 38°C ± 3°C (100°F ± 5°F) for at least three hours and then adjusting the inflation pressure of the conditioned tire to that referred to in paragraph (a);
	- **(c)** mounting the assembled tire and rim on a test axle and pressing the tread of the tire against a flat-faced steel test wheel that is 1 707.6 mm (67.23 in.) in diameter and at least as wide as the section width of the tire;
	- **(d)** maintaining the air surrounding the test area at 38°C ± 3°C (100°F ± 5°F);
	- **(e)** running the tire for periods of 7 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours, under the test load and at the test wheel speed for the particular period as specified in Table II, without any adjustment to the inflation pressure of the tire;
	- **(f)** measuring the inflation pressure of the tire immediately after running it for the total number of hours required by paragraph (e); and
	- **(g)** deflating the tire, removing it from the rim after allowing it to cool and inspecting it for visible evidence of tread separation, sidewall separation, ply separation, cord separation, innerliner separation, bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking or open splices.



### High Speed Performance

**7** 

- **(1)** Where a motorcycle tire or a tire that is designed to fit a rim having a diameter of 368.3 mm (14.5 in.) or less and that has a load range designation of “A”, “B”, “C” or “D” moulded into or onto the sidewalls in accordance with subparagraph 10(1)(a)(viii) of these Regulations, other than a tire having a speed restriction of 88.5 km/h (55 m.p.h.) or less moulded into or onto the sidewalls in accordance with subparagraph 10(1)(a)(iii) of these Regulations, is subjected to the high speed performance test in accordance with subsection (2), the tire shall
	- **(a)** at the end of the test, have
		- **(i)** no visible evidence of tread separation, sidewall separation, ply separation, cord separation, innerliner separation, bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking or open splices, and
		- **(ii)** a tire inflation pressure that is not less than the tire inflation pressure at the beginning of the test; and
	- **(b)** meet the requirement of the high speed performance test referred to in subsection (2) where tested on a test wheel alone or simultaneously with not more than five other tires.

- **(2)** The high speed performance test shall be performed by
