## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Faro Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means the Faro Airport, in the vicinity of Faro, in the Yukon Territory; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de référence de l’aéroport*)

***approach surfaces*** means the imaginary inclined planes that extend upward and outward from each end of a strip, which planes are more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surfaces d’approche*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, that is prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which rectangular portion is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surfaces*** means the imaginary inclined planes that extend upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and the approach surfaces, which planes are more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule. (*surfaces de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 711.4 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all land, including public road allowances, that lies directly beneath the approach surfaces or transitional surfaces, which surfaces are more particularly described in Parts II and IV of the schedule.
> SOR/96-437, s. 13.





## Building Restrictions


**4** No person shall erect or construct, on land to which these Regulations apply, a building, structure or object or an addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces; or
- **(b)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth that is on land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excess growth.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, shown on Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043, dated March 9, l995, is a point located on the centre line of runway 08-26 at a distance of 609.5 m from the threshold of runway 08.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043, dated March 9, l995, are planes abutting each end of the strip associated with runway 08-26 and are described as follows:

**(a)** an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 08 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 26 having a ratio of l m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 08-26, shown on Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043, dated March 9, l995, is 90 m in width, 45 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 339 m in length.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Transitional Surfaces

Each transitional surface, shown on Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043, dated March 9, 1995, is an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to a height of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point.
