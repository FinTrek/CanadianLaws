## Units of Measurement


**9** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of these Regulations, all gas shall be measured in units of measurement that meet the requirements of the [Electricity and Gas Inspection Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-4.md), and

	- **(b)** in the case of thermal measurement, shall be computed as the number of joules on a dry basis, where dry gas has a moisture content of less than 110 mg/m<sup>3</sup>.

- **(2)** Where volume is measured under conditions of temperature and pressure other than the standard conditions described in paragraph (1)(a), the volume shall be converted to the equivalent under the standard conditions, in accordance with the Ideal Gas Laws, and shall be corrected for deviations from the Ideal Gas Laws in accordance with subsection (3), where the amount of the deviation exceeds one per cent.

- **(3)** Correction for deviation from the Ideal Gas Laws shall be based on the tables published in American Gas Association (AGA) Report No. 3, Orifice Metering of Natural Gas and Other Related Hydrocarbon Fluids, as amended from time to time.
