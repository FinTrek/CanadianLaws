### Contribution of the Government of Canada and Jurisdictions


**7** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of the sharing of an amount determined pursuant to section 5, the Attorney General shall assess the contribution of the Government of Canada and of each of the relevant jurisdictions on the basis of the following:
	- **(a)** the nature of information provided by the agencies of the Government of Canada and each jurisdiction, and the importance of that information; and
	- **(b)** the participation by the agencies of the Government of Canada and each jurisdiction in the investigation and prosecution that lead to forfeiture or the imposition of a fine.

- **(2)** The Attorney General may, for the purposes of an assessment referred to in subsection (1), consult with the relevant agencies and jurisdictions.

- **(3)** The Attorney General shall assign a percentage representing the contribution of the Government of Canada and of each relevant jurisdiction, as compared with the contribution of another jurisdiction or group of jurisdictions, as the case may be, determined as follows:
	- **(a)** where the contribution of the Government of Canada or a jurisdiction constitutes the predominant portion of the total contribution, it shall be considered to be 90 per cent;
	- **(b)** where the contribution of the Government of Canada or a jurisdiction constitutes a significant portion of the total contribution, it shall be considered to be 50 per cent; and
	- **(c)** where the contribution of the Government of Canada or a jurisdiction constitutes a minimal portion of the total contribution, it shall be considered to be 10 per cent.

- **(4)** The Attorney General shall determine the contribution, expressed as a percentage in accordance with subsection (3), of the Government of Canada and of each of the following jurisdictions and groups of jurisdictions, in the following order:
	- **(a)** determine the contribution of the Government of Canada and the contribution of the group of all relevant jurisdictions;
	- **(b)** determine the contribution of the jurisdiction that has the highest level of contribution from among the group of other jurisdictions referred to in paragraph (a), and the contribution of the group of remaining jurisdictions;
	- **(c)** repeat the method set out in paragraph (b), for the group of remaining jurisdictions, until only two jurisdictions remain; and
	- **(d)** where only two jurisdictions remain, determine the contribution of each of those jurisdictions.

- **(5)** The percentage that represents the contribution of the Government of Canada shall in no case be less than 10 per cent.



**8** The Attorney General shall provide to the Minister the percentages that represent the respective contributions, assigned pursuant to section 7, of the Government of Canada and the relevant jurisdictions and groups of jurisdictions.




### Calculation and Payment of Shares


**9** The Minister shall, in accordance with the percentages referred to in section 8, calculate the Government of Canada’s share and each relevant jurisdiction’s share of an amount determined in accordance with section 5, as follows:
- **(a)** calculate the share of the Government of Canada by multiplying the amount available for sharing by the percentage that represents the contribution of the Government of Canada;
- **(b)** subtract the product obtained in the preceding paragraph from the amount available for sharing, the remainder being the first residual amount available for sharing;
- **(c)** if there is only one remaining jurisdiction, the share of that jurisdiction is the residual amount referred to in paragraph (b), otherwise calculate the share of the jurisdiction that has the highest level of contribution as determined under paragraph 7(4)(b) by multiplying the first residual amount available for sharing obtained in accordance with the preceding paragraph by the percentage that represents the contribution of that jurisdiction;
- **(d)** subtract the product obtained in the preceding paragraph from the first residual amount available for sharing in the preceding paragraph, the remainder being the new residual amount available for sharing;
- **(e)** repeat the method set out in paragraphs (c) and (d), with such modifications as the circumstances require, until such time as the shares of only two jurisdictions remain to be calculated; and
- **(f)** where the shares of only two jurisdictions remain to be calculated, calculate the shares of those jurisdictions by multiplying the new residual amount available for sharing obtained in accordance with the preceding step by the percentages that represent the respective contributions of those jurisdictions.



**10** The Minister shall pay to each relevant jurisdiction the amount of the share, calculated in accordance with section 9, for that jurisdiction by sending that amount to the government of a relevant province or to the appropriate official as specified in an agreement referred to in section 3.



**11** Where a government of a province signs a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Canada respecting the allocation by the province of a portion of a share received under section 10, the allocation of that portion shall be consistent with the memorandum of understanding.
