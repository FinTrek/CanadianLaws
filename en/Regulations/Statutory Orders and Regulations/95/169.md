- **(2)** Where a participant’s entitlement to an annual benefit under these Regulations ceases as described in subsection (1), that entitlement will not recommence where the participant subsequently ceases to be employed in the Public Service, within the meaning of subsection 3(1) of the [Public Service Superannuation Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-36.md).

## Supplementary Benefits


**11** Supplementary benefits shall be paid in respect of periodic payments payable under these Regulations at the same rates and in the same manner as are supplementary retirement benefits under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md).




## Recovery of Overpayments


**12** Where, under these Regulations, an amount has been paid in error to a person, an amount equal to the amount paid in error shall be recovered in the same manner as that specified in section 20 of the [Retirement Compensation Arrangements Regulations, No. 1](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/94/785.md), with such modifications as the circumstances require.
