**Retention of electronic format of document or information**

**10** A document or information that is created, sent or received by the Minister or the Commission and that must be retained may be retained in an electronic format if
- **(a)** when the document or information is created, sent or received,
	- **(i)** in the case of a document or information in a non-electronic format, it is retained in a format that does not alter its contents, or

		- **(B)** in a format that accurately represents the electronic document or the electronic information that was originally created, sent or received;
- **(b)** the contents of the electronic document or the electronic information and its related metadata are readable or perceivable so as to be usable for subsequent reference; and
- **(c)** the format and the medium in which the electronic document or the electronic information is retained provide a reliable means of maintaining, from the time the source document or information is created, sent or received, the integrity of the electronic document or the electronic information, including the integrity of the record of retention actions and administrative activities, apart from any changes or additions made in the normal course of communication, storage or display.




**Date and hour retained**

**11** If details are generated concerning the date and the hour when an electronic document or electronic information is sent or received by the Minister or the Commission, those details must be retained by the Minister or the Commission.




**Standard of reliability**

**12** The standard of reliability required with respect to an electronic document or electronic information must be established in light of the purpose for which the document or the information is created, sent or received by the Minister or the Commission.




**Integrity maintained throughout retention period**

**13**

- **(2)** The integrity of an electronic document or electronic information must be assessed in light of the security measures that have been applied to

	- **(b)** the electronic system in which the electronic document or the electronic information is created, sent, received or retained.

**Additional criteria for maintaining integrity**

- **(3)** The integrity of an electronic document or electronic information is maintained if it is possible to verify that the document or the information and its related metadata have not been altered, apart from the alterations set out in subsection 14(2), even if the document or the information has been fragmented, compressed or stored for a limited time to increase the efficiency of its transmission.

**Presumptions when integrity maintained**

- **(4)** An electronic document or electronic information whose integrity has been maintained
	- **(a)** may be used in the place of the source document or information;
	- **(b)** is not invalid or unenforceable solely because it is in electronic format; and
