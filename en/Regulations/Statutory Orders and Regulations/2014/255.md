## Special Payments



**Amount determined by Minister**

**5** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of section 7 of the Act, the special payment amount for a province as determined by the Minister after consultation with the Chief Statistician of Canada is the amount for the fiscal year that is obtained by multiplying the total costs for the fiscal year for provinces where apprentices registered with those provinces are able to enter into apprentice loan agreements for the fiscal year, by the ratio of the estimated number of persons in the province in question who are at least 16 years of age but less than 65, to the estimated number of persons of those ages in provinces where apprentices registered with those provinces are able to enter into apprentice loan agreements.

**Total costs**

- **(2)** In this section, total costs for a fiscal year means the amount determined by the formula
```
A + B - C
```
where
- **A** is the estimated aggregate of all amounts paid by the Minister in that fiscal year to service providers under the Act and to collection agencies in respect of apprentice loans;
- **B** is the estimated aggregate of
- **(a)** the amount of interest calculated at the rate of interest referred to in subsection (3) in that fiscal year in respect of outstanding apprentice loans referred to in the description of A made under an apprentice loan agreement,
- **(b)** the amount by which the outstanding principal in respect of all apprentice loans referred to in paragraph (a) has been reduced in that fiscal year in accordance with these Regulations,
- **(c)** the amount of the outstanding principal and interest in respect of all apprentice loans referred to in paragraph (a) for which the borrower’s obligations have terminated in that fiscal year as a result of the death or severe permanent disability of the borrower, and
- **(d)** the amount of the outstanding principal and interest in respect of all apprentice loans referred to in paragraph (a) for which the Minister has commenced collection action in that fiscal year, minus the amount of the outstanding principal and interest in respect of apprentice loans referred to in that paragraph for which the Minister has ended collection action in that fiscal year due to the occurrence of an event described in section 7 that resulted in the removal of restrictions to financial assistance; and
- **C** is the estimated aggregate of
- **(a)** the amount of interest received by or on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada in that fiscal year in respect of apprentice loans, and
- **(b)** any amounts received by or on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada in that fiscal year pursuant to collection action taken by the Minister in respect of apprentice loans.

**Rate of interest**

- **(3)** The rate of interest for the purposes of paragraph (a) of the description of B in subsection (2) is the average percentage yield, during the fiscal year in question, of Benchmark Bonds issued by the Government of Canada maturing in 10 years, as published by the Bank of Canada.

	- **(b)** at least one of the following conditions is met:
		- **(i)** the borrower has a permanent disability, and

	- **(c)** the borrower’s monthly affordable payment calculated in accordance with subsection (2) is less than their monthly required payment calculated in accordance with subsection (3).

**Monthly affordable payment**

- **(2)** The monthly affordable payment is equal to

		- **(i)** $0, if the borrower’s monthly family income, less their monthly disability-related expenses not covered by their provincial health care or private insurance plan, is no more than the monthly income threshold for their family size determined in accordance with the table set out in Schedule 2, or
		- **(ii)** otherwise, the borrower’s monthly family income multiplied by the lesser of the amounts determined by the following formulae:
```
0.2A
```

```
1.5[((W – Y)) ÷ (100Z)+0.01]A
```
where
- **A** is, in relation to apprentice loans, student loans, guaranteed student loans and provincial loans, the ratio of the borrower’s outstanding principal for which instalments are due to the sum of that amount and the outstanding principal for which instalments are due for any loan of the same type to a spouse or common-law partner of the borrower,

	- **(a)** the outstanding principal of the apprentice loans made to the borrower for which instalments are due, amortized over a period of the greater of six months and
		- **(i)** in the case of a borrower who has a permanent disability, 120 months minus the number of months that have passed since the day referred to in paragraph 10(1)(b), and
		- **(ii)** in any other case, 180 months minus the number of months that have passed since the day referred to in paragraph 10(1)(b); and
	- **(b)** the monthly required payment calculated under
		- **(i)** paragraphs 19(3)(a) and (b) of the [Canada Student Financial Assistance Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/95/329.md), or

**Reduction of principal and interest**

- **(2)** The amount owing as outstanding principal of apprentice loans and interest on those loans for a month during a repayment assistance period by a borrower is reduced by the Minister by the difference between the monthly required payment calculated in accordance with paragraph 12(3)(a) and the portion of the monthly affordable payment attributed to apprentice loans calculated in accordance with subsection (4). That reduction is made only in relation to the months for which the borrower complies with subsection (1).

**Definition of federal portion**

- **(3)** In this section, ***federal portion*** means
	- **(a)** if no instalments are due on account of outstanding principal under provincial loans, 100% of the affordable monthly payment; and

**Attribution of payments**

- **(4)** Payments made under this section are attributed in proportion to the outstanding principal of each apprentice loan, student loan and guaranteed student loan for which instalments are due.
