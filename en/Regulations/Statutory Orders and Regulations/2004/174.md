- **(2)** For greater certainty and except as described in subsection (1), a plan is not exempt from the application of subsections 8(1) and (2) of the Act in respect of any special payments, contributions or other amounts that are accrued or due to the pension fund under these Regulations.




### Application of Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985


**6** If the information referred to in section 4 is filed with the Superintendent in respect of a plan in accordance with that section, section 9 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) applies in respect of that plan except as otherwise provided in this Part.



**7** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of this Part, paragraph (a) of the definition ***solvency deficiency*** in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) shall be read as follows:
	- **(a)** the value of the assets of the plan, determined on the basis of market value,

- **(2)** In this Part, for the purpose of paragraph (d) of the definition ***solvency deficiency*** in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), the present value of any special payment calculated before January 1, 2004 and the present value of any special payment required to be made in respect of an initial unfunded liability emerging as at January 1, 2004 shall be zero.

- **(3)** For the purposes of this Part, the definition ***solvency deficiency*** in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) shall be read as including the following after paragraph (d):
	- **(d.1)** the present value of any special payment referred to in section 9 or 13 of the Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations,
	- **(d.2)** the present value of any special payment required to be made during the period beginning on January 2, 2004 and ending on December 31, 2013 in respect of an initial unfunded liability of a plan emerging after January 1, 2004,

- **(4)** Subject to subsection 147.2(2) of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md), subsection 9(7.1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) does not apply in respect of a plan that is funded in accordance with this Part.




### Solvency Ratio


**8** 

- **(1)** The initial solvency deficiency of a plan shall be calculated as if any applicable special payments referred to in paragraph 11(c) of the Protocol had been remitted to the pension fund on December 31, 2003.

- **(2)** The solvency ratio of a plan as at January 1, 2004 shall be calculated after determining the initial solvency deficiency in accordance with subsection (1).




### Funding — Special Payments


**9** 

- **(1)** The following definitions apply in this section.

***adjusted aggregate amount*** means, in respect of a plan year, the adjusted aggregate amount of annual special payments for that plan year as determined in accordance with subsection (4) or in accordance with subsections (4) and (5), as applicable. (*total rajusté*)

***unadjusted aggregate amount*** means, in respect of a plan year, the unadjusted aggregate amount of annual special payments set out in the schedule for that plan year. (*total non rajusté*)

- **(2)** Notwithstanding subsection 9(4) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), an initial solvency deficiency of a plan shall be funded over a period not exceeding 10 years, beginning with the 2004 plan year and ending with the 2013 plan year, by an annual special payment to the pension fund in each of those years determined in accordance with subsections (3) to (5).

- **(3)** The amount of an annual special payment in respect of a plan for a plan year shall be determined by multiplying the adjusted aggregate amount for that plan year by the ratio of the initial solvency deficiency of the plan to the aggregate amount of the initial solvency deficiencies of all of the plans.

- **(4)** Subject to subsection (5), the adjusted aggregate amount in respect of a plan year set out in column 1 of the schedule shall be determined by multiplying the unadjusted aggregate amount set out for that plan year in column 2 by the greater of
	- **(a)** one, and
	- **(b)** the ratio of the aggregate amount of the initial solvency deficiencies of all of the plans to the sum of the present values, as at January 1, 2004, of each of the unadjusted aggregate amounts set out in column 2.

- **(5)** If the adjusted aggregate amount determined in accordance with subsection (4) for the 2004 plan year is less than the result obtained by multiplying the assumed interest rate used in the valuation of the liabilities of the plans for the purpose of calculating their initial solvency deficiencies by the aggregate amount of the initial solvency deficiencies of all of those plans,
	- **(a)** the adjusted aggregate amount for the 2004 plan year shall be an amount equal to that result; and
	- **(b)** the adjusted aggregate amount for each of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 plan years may be reduced by an equal amount for each of those plan years such that the sum of the present values, as at January 1, 2004, of each of the adjusted aggregate amounts determined for the 10 plan years referred to in subsection (2) is the same as it would be if it were calculated without reference to paragraph (a).

- **(6)** Air Canada shall, not later than 14 days after the expiration of the initial order, provide the Superintendent with a payment schedule setting out for each plan the amount of the annual special payment required to be made in each of the 10 plan years referred to in subsection (2) calculated in accordance with subsections (3) to (5).

- **(7)** Notwithstanding subsection 9(14) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), the annual special payment referred to in subsection (2) in respect of the 2004 plan year shall be made in two installments as follows:
	- **(a)** the first installment, in an amount equal to 75 per cent of that annual special payment, shall be remitted not later than the later of
		- **(i)** October 30, 2004, and
		- **(ii)** 30 days after the day on which these Regulations come into force; and
	- **(b)** the second installment, in an amount equal to 25 per cent of that annual special payment, shall be remitted not later than January 30, 2005.

- **(8)** For greater certainty, the following special payments are not required to be paid in respect of a plan in a plan year:
	- **(a)** any special payment required to liquidate an initial unfunded liability emerging as at January 1, 2004 that would have been required to be paid in respect of that plan year under subsection 9(3) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md); and
	- **(b)** any special payment calculated in accordance with an actuarial report filed with the Superintendent before January 1, 2004 that would have been required to be paid in respect of that plan year under subsection 9(3) or (4) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md).



**10** For the purposes of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), a payment that is required to be made in respect of a plan by section 9 or 13 or subsection 16(2) shall be considered a special payment.



**11** A plan shall be funded in each plan year by the special payments referred to in sections 9 and 13 in addition to the contributions and any applicable special payments set out in subsection 9(7) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md).




### Actuarial Gain


**12** Until the 2006 plan year, an actuarial gain shall not be used to reduce the amount of any special payments due to the pension fund, but it may be applied to reduce the amortization period or periods applicable to the payment of a solvency deficiency or used to reduce, on a *pro rata* basis, the special payments required to fund the solvency deficiency during any of the 2006 to 2013 plan years.




### Solvency Deficiency Emerging After 2004 Plan Year


**13** Except as provided in section 15, a solvency deficiency that emerges in a plan year that begins after the day on which these Regulations come into force shall be funded by equal annual special payments sufficient to liquidate the solvency deficiency over a period not exceeding the greater of
- **(a)** the number of years remaining in the payment schedule referred to in section 9, calculated from the beginning of the plan year in which the solvency deficiency emerges, and
- **(b)** five years.




### Amendments to a Plan


**14** For the purpose of paragraph 10.1(2)(b) of the Act, the prescribed solvency ratio level is the solvency ratio calculated on the basis of the most recent actuarial report filed with the Superintendent in accordance with subsection 12(3) of the Act.




### Increase in Benefits


**15** 

- **(1)** A solvency deficiency that emerges after the day on which these Regulations come into force and that results from an increase in pension benefits, pension benefit credits or other benefits payable under a plan shall be funded in accordance with subsection 9(4) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md).

- **(2)** The present value of the special payments required to fund the solvency deficiency referred to in subsection (1) shall be included for the purpose of paragraph (d) of the definition ***solvency deficiency*** in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md).




### Termination of Plan with a Deficit


**16** 

- **(1)** In this section, ***deficit*** means the amount by which the liabilities of a plan exceed its assets.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), if a plan is fully terminated and the plan has a deficit as at the day of the termination, the annual payments due in respect of the principal outstanding amount of the promissory note that is issued in respect of the plan and referred to in section 4 of the Protocol shall be remitted to the pension fund as they become due and payable, until such time as the principal outstanding amount of that promissory note is paid or the deficit is eliminated, whichever is earlier.

- **(3)** If the principal outstanding amount of the promissory note referred to in subsection (2) becomes due and payable in full as a result of the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of the promissory note, the annual payments referred to in that subsection are not required to be remitted.
