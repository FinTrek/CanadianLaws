# Edmonton Garrison Heliport Zoning Regulations

**SOR/2004-86**

Enabling authorities: 
- [AERONAUTICS ACT](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md)

Date registered: 22 April 2004

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 5.5(1)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), a copy of the proposed Edmonton Garrison Heliport Zoning Regulations, substantially in the annexed form, was published in two successive issues of a newspaper serving the area to which the proposed Regulations relate, namely on March 28 and 29, 2002, and in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette, Part I, on March 30 and April 6, 2002, and a reasonable opportunity was afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of National Defence with respect to the proposed Regulations;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1<br />

And whereas the proposed Regulations would prevent lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Edmonton Garrison Heliport from being used or developed in a manner that is, in the opinion of the Minister of National Defence, incompatible with the safe operation of an airport or aircraft;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to paragraph 5.4(2)(b)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), hereby makes the annexed Edmonton Garrison Heliport Zoning Regulations.
