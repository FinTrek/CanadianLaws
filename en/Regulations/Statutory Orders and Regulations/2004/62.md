		- **(ii)** 25% of the aggregate of taxable income earned in the taxation year in the province, as determined by the Minister of National Revenue under subsection 124(4) of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md), for all corporations having a taxation year ending in the calendar year that begins in the fiscal year.

**3.1** 

- **(1)** For the purpose of subsection (2), ***national average rate of tax*** means, in respect of a revenue source for a fiscal year, the rate equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate of the federal income tax reduction for the revenue source for the fiscal year for all provinces, excluding the territories, by the revenue base for the revenue source for the fiscal year for all provinces, excluding the territories.

- **(2)** For the purposes of the calculation under subparagraph 24.7(1.2)(b)(ii) and paragraph 24.7(1.22)(a) of the Act,
	- **(a)** per capita national yield of the federal income tax reduction for a revenue source for a fiscal year is determined by dividing the product of the national average rate of tax for the revenue source for the fiscal year and the aggregate revenue base of all provinces, excluding the territories, for the revenue source for the fiscal year by the population of all provinces, excluding the territories, for the fiscal year; and
	- **(b)** per capita yield of the federal income tax reduction, in respect of a province for a revenue source for a fiscal year, is determined by dividing the product of the national average rate of tax for the revenue source for the fiscal year and the province’s revenue base for the revenue source for the fiscal year by the population of the province for the fiscal year.
