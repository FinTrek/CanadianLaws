	- **(a)** in the case of a female chicken broiler breeder that is 25 weeks of age or younger or a chicken table egg layer that is 19 weeks of age or younger, in accordance with the formula
```
B + [(A - B)/D]E
```

	- **(b)** in the case of a female chicken broiler breeder that is older than 25 weeks of age or a chicken table egg layer that is older than 19 weeks of age, in accordance with the formula
```
A + [(C - A)/(F - D)](E - D)
```
where
- **A** is the maximum amount with respect to a chicken under section 2 of the [Compensation for Destroyed Animals Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2000/233.md);
- **B** is the value of a day-old female chicken broiler breeder or a day-old chicken table egg layer, as the case may be;
- **C** is the salvage value of the chicken;
- **D** is 25 weeks in the case of a female chicken broiler breeder and 19 weeks in the case of a chicken table egg layer;
- **E** is the age of the chicken, in weeks, when it was destroyed; and
- **F** is the length, in weeks, of the average production cycle of a female chicken broiler breeder or a chicken table egg layer, as the case may be.

- **(2)** The market value of a chicken shall not exceed the maximum amount with respect to a chicken under section 2 of the [Compensation for Destroyed Animals Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2000/233.md).

B + [(A - B)/D]E
```

	- **(b)** in the case of a duck that is older than 22 weeks of age, in accordance with the formula
```
A + [(C - A)/(F - D)](E - D)
