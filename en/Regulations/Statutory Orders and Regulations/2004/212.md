The elevation of the strip surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centreline of the strip surface.


The elevation of the strip centreline between the strip surface end and the closest strip surface threshold is equal to the elevation of the strip surface end. The elevation of the strip surface centreline between the strip surface thresholds is calculated using a constant ratio between the elevations of the strip surface thresholds.


The strip surfaces, shown on Pickering Airport Site Zoning Plan No. 18-001 02-041, Sheets 16 and 17, dated October 30, 2002, are described as follows:

**(a)** the strip surface associated with proposed runway 09-27 is 1 062 m in total width, being 531 m on either side of the centre line of the proposed runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the west of threshold 09 and ends 60 m to the east of threshold 27, having a total length of 6 947.52 m. The 09 end of the strip surface has an elevation of 205 m and the 27 end of the strip surface has an elevation of 230 m. The azimuth of the centre line from threshold 09 to threshold 27 is 79°47′30″. Threshold 09 having the grid coordinates of 643 976.29 E and 4 864 443.47 N and threshold 27 having the grid coordinates of 650 694.60 E and 4 865 653.29 N;
