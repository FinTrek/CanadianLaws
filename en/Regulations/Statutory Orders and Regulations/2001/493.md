Date registered: 8 November 2001

----------

Whereas the taxation of property interests within reserves is an important element of self-government;

Whereas, to facilitate the implementation of property taxation on reserve land, the First Nations set out in Schedule 1 to the annexed Regulations wish to provide railway companies occupying reserve land with levels of property taxation that are predictable and comparable to levels of property taxation under provincial laws, and have requested that the Governor in Council make those Regulations;

And whereas the Indian Taxation Advisory Board was established by Canada to, among other things, advise and assist the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on policy issues related to section 83 of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md), to foster harmony between taxation by First Nations and taxation by other authorities and to ensure compliance with the principles of equity, natural justice and fairness;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, pursuant to subsection 83(5)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md), hereby makes the annexed Property Assessment and Taxation (Railway Right-of-Way) Regulations.
