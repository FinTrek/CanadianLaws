**PART 2** 
## Corporate Names



### Interpretation


**17** The following definitions apply in this Part.

***confusing***, in relation to a corporate name, means a corporate name the use of which causes confusion with a trade-mark, an official mark or a trade-name in the manner described in section 18. (*prête à confusion*)

***corporate name*** means the name of a corporation. (*Version anglaise seulement*)

***distinctive***, in relation to a trade-name, means a trade-name that distinguishes the business in association with which it is used by its owner from any other business or that is adapted so as to distinguish them from each other. (*distinctive*)

***official mark*** means an official mark within the meaning of subparagraph 9(1)(n)(iii) of the Trade-marks Act.(*marque officielle*)

***secondary meaning***, in relation to a trade-name, means a trade-name that has been used in Canada or elsewhere by an applicant or by their predecessors so as to have become distinctive in Canada as at the date of filing an application for a corporate name. (*sens dérivé*)

***trade-mark*** has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Trade-marks Act. (*marque de commerce*)

***trade-name*** means the name under which a business is carried on, whether it is a corporate name or the name of a body corporate, a trust, a partnership, a sole proprietorship or an individual. (*dénomination commerciale*)

***use*** means actual use by a person that carries on business in Canada or elsewhere. (*emploi*)




### Confusion of Names


**18** A corporate name is confusing with
- **(a)** a trade-mark or an official mark if the use of both the corporate name and either the trade-mark or the official mark, as the case may be, is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the corporate name and the business connected with the trade-mark or the official mark, as the case may be, are one business, whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same; or
- **(b)** a trade-name if the use of both names is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the corporate name and the business carried on under the trade-name are one business, whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same.




### Consideration of Whole Name


**19** When determining whether a trade-name is distinctive, the name as a whole and not only its separate elements shall be considered.




### Prohibited Names


**20** For the purpose of paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Act, a corporate name is prohibited in respect of a request to reserve a name or in respect of an application for revival under section 209 of the Act, if it is the same as, or is confusing with, a corporate name that has, before the date of the request, been reserved by the Director for another person, unless
- **(a)** written consent has been obtained from the person for whom the corporate name was reserved; or
- **(b)** the 90-day reservation period referred to in subsection 11(1) of the Act has expired without the person for whom the corporate name was reserved having made a renewed request to reserve the corporate name.



**21** For the purpose of paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Act, a corporate name is prohibited if the name contains any of the following elements:

- **(b)** is sponsored or controlled by or is connected with the Government of Canada, the government of a province, the government of a country other than Canada or a political subdivision or agency of any such government, unless the appropriate government, political subdivision or agency consents in writing to the use of the name;
- **(c)** is sponsored or controlled by or is connected with a university or an association of accountants, architects, engineers, lawyers, physicians or surgeons or another professional association recognized by the laws of Canada or a province, unless the appropriate university or professional association consents in writing to the use of the name; or

**23** For the purpose of paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Act, a corporate name is prohibited if it contains a word or phrase, or connotes a business, that is obscene.



**24** 

- **(1)** For the purpose of paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Act and subject to subsection (2), a corporate name is prohibited if the corporate name is not distinctive because it
	- **(a)** is only descriptive, in any language, of the business of the corporation, of the goods and services in which the corporation deals or intends to deal, or of the quality, function or other characteristic of those goods and services;
	- **(b)** is primarily or only the name or surname, used alone, of an individual who is living or has died within 30 years before the date of the request to the Director for that name; or
	- **(c)** is primarily or only a geographic name, used alone.

**30** 

- **(1)** For the purpose of paragraph 12(1)(a) of the Act, a corporate name that is confusing with the name of a body corporate is prohibited unless
