LD<sub>50</sub> = 1/[(P<sub>a</sub>/LD<sub>50a</sub>)+(P<sub>b</sub>/LD<sub>50b</sub>)+...+(P<sub>n</sub>/LD<sub>50n</sub>)]
```
where
- **LD** <sub>50</sub>represents the LD<sub>50</sub> of the mixture,
- **LD** <sub>50a</sub>** to LD** <sub>50n</sub>represent the LD<sub>50</sub> of each ingredient that is present in a concentration of 1% or more, and
- **P** <sub>a</sub>** to P** <sub>n</sub>represent the proportion by weight of each ingredient that is present in a concentration of 1% or more; or
	- **(b)** for a gas, vapour, dust, mist or fume
```
LC<sub>50</sub> = 1/[(P<sub>a</sub>/LC<sub>50a</sub>)+(P<sub>b</sub>/LC<sub>50b</sub>)+...+(P<sub>n</sub>/LC<sub>50n</sub>)]
```
where
- **LC** <sub>50</sub>represents the LC<sub>50</sub> of the mixture,
- **LC** <sub>50a</sub>** to LC** <sub>50n</sub>represent the LC<sub>50</sub> of each ingredient that is present in a concentration of 1% or more, and
- **P** <sub>a</sub>** to P** <sub>n</sub>represent the proportion by weight of each ingredient that is present in a concentration of 1% or more.

**Complex mixture**

- **(2)** For the purposes of the additivity formulas set out in subsection (1), “ingredient” includes a complex mixture.

**When LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> of ingredient is not known but can be estimated**

- **(3)** When the LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> of one or more ingredients present in a chemical product in a concentration of 1% or more is not known, the person responsible may, in the additivity formulas set out in subsection (1), use an estimated LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> determined in accordance with good scientific practices.

**When LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> of ingredient is not known and cannot be estimated**

- **(4)** When the LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> of one or more ingredients present in a chemical product is not known and cannot be estimated from information referred to in paragraph 35(1)(b) or (c), the person responsible, in the additivity formulas set out in subsection (1), must substitute for the LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> of the ingredient, the LD<sub>50</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> of the most toxic known ingredient that is present in the product at a concentration of 1% or more.




**Conversion to a 4-hour LC<sub>50</sub>**

**37** An LC<sub>50</sub> obtained during a duration of exposure of other than four hours must be converted to an LC<sub>50</sub> equivalent to a duration of exposure of four hours by using one of the following formulas, as the case may be:
- **(a)** for a gas or vapour
```
LC<sub>50 of 4 hours</sub> = (LC<sub>50y</sub>)(y<sup>½</sup>/2)
```
where
- **LC** <sub>50 of 4 hours</sub>represents the LC<sub>50</sub> of the mixture for a duration of exposure of four hours,
- **LC** <sub>50y</sub>represents the LC<sub>50</sub> of the mixture for a duration of exposure of y hours, and
- **y** represents the actual duration of exposure expressed in hours and must be no greater than 10 hours; or
- **(b)** for a dust, mist or fume
```
LC<sub>50 of 4 hours</sub> = (LC<sub>50y</sub>)(y/4)
```
where
- **LC** <sub>50 of 4 hours</sub>represents the LC<sub>50</sub> of the mixture for a duration of exposure of four hours,
- **LC** <sub>50y</sub>represents the LC<sub>50</sub> of the mixture for a duration of exposure of y hours, and
- **y** represents the actual duration of exposure expressed in hours and must be no greater than 10 hours.

	- **(a)** subject to subsection (2), human experience data for the corrosive product;
	- **(b)** the table to subsection 42(1), in the case of a corrosive product that contains a substance of special concern;
	- **(c)** one or more of the following sources in the following order of precedence, in the case of a corrosive product that contains one or more acids or one or more bases:
		- **(i)** the data sources set out in paragraph 6(1)(b), (c) or (e), or
		- **(ii)** the pH and, if applicable, the acid reserve or the alkali reserve of the corrosive product as set out in the tables to subsections 42(2) and (3), determined using the test methods set out in section 44;
	- **(d)** the table to subsection 42(4), in the case of a corrosive product that contains a substance, other than an acid or a base, that is capable of inducing necrosis or ulceration of epithelial tissue at the site of application determined using the data sources set out in subsection 43(1); or
	- **(e)** subsection 42(5), in the case of a corrosive product that contains a substance, other than an acid or a base, that is capable, when tested using the appropriate test methods set out in subsection 43(2), of causing any of the following at the site of application:
		- **(i)** an erythema or edema of the skin graded at 2 or more,
		- **(ii)** corneal damage graded at 2 or more,
		- **(iii)** iris damage graded at 1 or more, or
		- **(iv)** conjunctival swelling or redness graded at 2.5 or more.

**Classification using human experience data**

- **(2)** If the human experience data for a corrosive product demonstrates that the product is capable of causing an effect described in
	- **(a)** paragraph (1)(d), the product must be classified in the sub-category “corrosive”; or
	- **(b)** any of subparagraphs (1)(e)(i) to (iv), the product must be classified in the sub-category “irritant”.

### Test Methods



**Determination — necrosis and ulceration**

**43** 

- **(1)** The capability of a substance in a corrosive product to induce necrosis or ulceration of epithelial tissue at the site of application must be determined from an applicable data source set out in paragraphs 6(1)(a) to (c) or (e).

**Determination — other effects**

- **(2)** The capability of a substance in a corrosive product to cause an erythema or edema of the skin, corneal or iris damage or conjunctive swelling or redness at the site of application, to the grade specified in paragraph 41(1)(e), must be determined from the applicable data source set out in paragraphs 6(1)(a) to (c) or (e), including
	- **(a)** the Draize Test;
	- **(b)** in the case of an erythema or an edema, OECD No. 404; and
	- **(c)** in the case of corneal or iris damage or conjunctive swelling or redness, OECD No. 405.




**Determination of the pH**

**44** 

- **(1)** The person responsible for a corrosive product must determine the pH of the product by using good scientific practices that are in accordance with a procedure similar to that described in ASTM D 1293, from
	- **(a)** in the case of a product in the form of a liquid, the product as it is dispensed from its container; and
	- **(b)** in the case of a product in the form of a solid, paste or gel, or in a form otherwise unsuitable for direct measurement of the pH, a 10% aqueous solution of the product.

**Determination of acid reserve or alkali reserve**

- **(2)** The person responsible for a corrosive product must determine, where applicable, the acid reserve or the alkali reserve of the product by
	- **(a)** titrating, in accordance with the OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice,
		- **(i)** in the case of a product in the form of a liquid, a suitable aliquot of the product as it is dispensed from its container, and
		- **(ii)** in the case of a product in the form of a solid, paste or gel, or in a form otherwise unsuitable for direct measurement of the pH, a suitable aliquot of a 10% aqueous solution of the product; and
	- **(b)** calculating
		- **(i)** in the case of an acidic product, the amount of an alkali, expressed in grams of sodium hydroxide, that is required to bring 100 mL of the product in the form of a liquid, or 100 g of the product in the form of a solid, paste or gel, to a pH of 4.00 ± 0.05, and
		- **(ii)** in the case of a basic product, the amount of an alkali, expressed in grams of sodium hydroxide, that is neutralized when 100 mL of the product in the form of a liquid, or 100 g of the product in the form of a solid, paste or gel, is brought to a pH of 10.00 ± 0.05 by the addition of hydrochloric acid.

**Unstable end point**

- **(3)** If the end point of the titration referred to in subsection (2) is unstable and exhibits drifting, the pH end point reached within 30 seconds after the last addition of titrant is to be used as the effective end point for classification purposes.

### **SCHEDULE 1** 
**(Subsections 1(1), 48(1) and 49(1) and section 52)**
## Test for Determining the Flashback and the Length of the Flame Projection of a Flammable Product Enclosed in a Spray Container

## Application

**1** This test is to be used to determine the flashback and the length of the flame projection of a flammable product enclosed in a spray container.



## Apparatus

**2** The following apparatus is to be used in this test:
- **(a)** a flammability tester, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 to the Schedule, that
	- **(i)** is constructed so that the spray container can be secured in place by means of a holding device, such as a three-pronged clamp affixed to a ring stand, in such a manner that the discharge from the spray container is in the horizontal plane,
	- **(ii)** may include a remote control device by which
		- **(A)** the valve of a pressurized container can be activated, such as a side-pull, caliper-type bicycle hand brake, or
		- **(B)** the trigger or plunger of a pump-spray container can be pneumatically activated, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 to the Schedule,
	- **(iii)** has a vertically mounted burner that
		- **(A)** has an inside diameter of 1.2 mm,
		- **(B)** has a Luer-Lock 16-gauge needle affixed to a metal tube or another suitable device, and
		- **(C)** is placed at a distance of 15 cm from the discharge orifice of the spray container, which distance is to be measured horizontally between the vertical planes of the discharge orifice and the burner orifice, and
	- **(iv)** has two support frameworks, placed on the opposite side of the burner from the spray container, one at a distance of 15 cm from the burner and the other at a distance of 100 cm from the burner, each of which
		- **(A)** has an internal open space of 35 cm wide by 45 cm high,
		- **(B)** is constructed from metal or other non-flammable material,
		- **(C)** is mounted in a vertical plane perpendicular to the direction of discharge from the spray container, and
		- **(D)** is adjustable in the vertical plane;
- **(b)** a cylinder of chemically pure grade propane fitted with a regulator capable of delivering pressure to the burner appropriate to maintaining a flame height of 5 cm; and
- **(c)** loosely woven cotton fabric commonly referred to as cheesecloth that has, in the bleached state, a mass per unit area of not less than 35 g/m<sup>2</sup> and not more than 65 g/m<sup>2</sup>.



## Test Specimen

**3** 

- **(1)** When there are instructions by the manufacturer respecting the shaking of the spray container, a test must be conducted as follows, using each of three spray containers of the same product and of the same size:
	- **(a)** if shaking is applicable, shake and discharge the container three times in the manner described in paragraph 4(9)(a); or
	- **(b)** if shaking is not applicable, discharge the container three times in the manner described in paragraph 4(9)(b).

- **(2)** When there are no instructions by the manufacturer respecting the shaking of the spray container, a test must be conducted as follows, using each of three spray containers of the same product and of the same size:
	- **(a)** without shaking the container, discharge it three times in the manner described in paragraph 4(9)(b); and
	- **(b)** shake and discharge the container a further three times in the manner described in paragraph 4(9)(a).



## Procedure

**4** 

- **(1)** A test
	- **(a)** must be conducted at a room temperature of 22 ± 2°C in the absence of air currents, with an allowance made for a clearance of 50 cm beyond the support framework that is set at a distance of 100 cm from the burner; and
	- **(b)** may be conducted in a fume hood with the exhaust fan turned off and the protecting door lowered.

- **(2)** Any fume must be removed from the test area and any residue cleaned up after each discharge.

- **(3)** Before testing, each spray container must be
	- **(a)** maintained at a temperature of 22 ± 2°C for at least four hours; and
	- **(b)** primed by
		- **(i)** in the case of a pressurized container, discharging the container for five seconds, and
		- **(ii)** in the case of a pump-spray container, activating the trigger or pump using each of 18 N, 36 N and 54 N of force for each possible nozzle position until
			- **(A)** in the case of the “stream” position, a continuous stream is produced, and
			- **(B)** in the case of the “spray” position, a mist is produced.

- **(4)** Install the first spray container in the holding device and ensure that the burner orifice is 15 cm from the discharge orifice of the spray container in the horizontal plane and 5 cm below it in the vertical plane and that the discharge orifice points in the direction of the burner.

- **(5)** Adjust the burner to give a flame height of 5 cm and release a single trial discharge from the spray container.

- **(6)** If the operation set out in subsection (5) does not produce a flame projection, lower the burner orifice by 5 cm and adjust the burner to give a flame height of 12 cm.

- **(7)** Attach the cheesecloth to the flammability tester with bulldog clips or in any other manner so as to cover the entire internal space of the support framework set at a distance of 15 cm from the burner and verify that the cheesecloth is at a proper horizontal distance from the vertical plane of the burner orifice on the opposite side of the burner from the spray container.

- **(8)** Adjust the height of the support framework so that the cheesecloth will intercept the line of flame projection.

- **(9)** Prepare the spray container in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and
	- **(a)** if shaking is applicable,
		- **(i)** shake vigorously for five seconds, or for the period specified in the manufacturer’s instructions,
		- **(ii)** install the spray container in the holding device, and
		- **(iii)** 15 seconds after the cessation of shaking, release the discharge in accordance with subsection (10); or
		- **(iv)** [Repealed, SOR/2009-165, s. 20]
	- **(b)** if shaking is not applicable, install the spray container in the holding device and release the discharge in accordance with subsection (10), allowing the spray container to stand for at least 60 seconds between discharges.

- **(10)** Discharge the spray container
	- **(a)** in the case of a pressurized container, for five seconds or until the cheesecloth ignites; or
	- **(b)** in the case of a pump-spray container, for three sprays or until the cheesecloth ignites.

- **(11)** In the case of a pump-spray container, repeat the procedure set out in paragraph (10)(b) for each of 18 N, 36 N and 54 N of force for each possible nozzle position.

- **(12)** If the cheesecloth attached to the support framework that is set at a distance of 15 cm from the burner ignites, the remaining discharges referred to in section 3 must be carried out in accordance with subsections (1) to (11) using a new piece of cheesecloth attached to the support framework that is set at a distance of 100 cm from the burner.



## Determination and Reporting of Flame Projection and Flashback

**5** 

- **(1)** If at any time during the test the cheesecloth that is mounted at a distance of 100 cm from the burner is ignited, the length of the flame projection is 100 cm or more.

- **(2)** If at any time during the test the cheesecloth that is mounted at a distance of 15 cm from the burner is ignited and, at all times during the test, the cheesecloth that is mounted at a distance of 100 cm from the burner remains unignited, the length of the flame projection is 15 cm or more but less than 100 cm.

- **(3)** If at any time during the test the cheesecloth mounted at a distance of 15 cm from the burner is not ignited but there is a flame projection, the length of the flame projection is less than 15 cm.


**6** The following test results must be recorded and kept for a period of at least three years after the testing is carried out:
- **(a)** the length of the flame projection
	- **(i)** in the case of a pressurized container, for each discharge, and
	- **(ii)** in the case of a pump-spray container, for each discharge at each nozzle position and each force applied;
- **(b)** a lack of flame projection resulting from any of the test discharges; and
- **(c)** any flashback.

### **SCHEDULE 3** 
**(Section 7)**
## Test Method for Determining Whether a Container Leaks

## Interpretation


**Definitions**

**1** The definitions in this section apply in this Schedule.

***seal***, in respect of a container, means any device or membrane under the closure that covers the opening of the container, including any membrane that is part of the container, such as a heat induction seal or a sonic seal. It does not include a liner or a mechanism that is an integral part of the closure. (*sceau d’étanchéité*)

***test sample*** means
- **(a)** in the case of a container of a chemical product, the container filled with the product in the manner in which it is sold to the consumer; or
- **(b)** in the case of an empty container that is destined to receive a chemical product, the container filled with the product that it is destined to receive. (*échantillon d’essai*)



## Test Method


### Preparation of Sample for Testing


**Remove seal**

**2** Except in the case of a single-use container,
- **(a)** open the test sample;
- **(b)** remove any seal that is present under the closure in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions or, if no instructions are provided, puncture the seal; and
- **(c)** reclose the sample as tightly as possible without stripping the threads of the closure.



**Bring to room temperature**

**3** Place the test sample in a test location that has a constant temperature of 23 ± 2°C for at least four hours to permit the container and its contents to reach the temperature of the test location.



### Testing for Leaks


**Position of test sample**

**4** Position the test sample
- **(a)** over a clean piece of blotting paper or another paper that stains on contact with a liquid;
- **(b)** in an inverted position at a 45° angle below the horizontal; and
- **(c)** with the closure in the lowest possible position and free of any obstruction.



**Examine paper**

**5** After one hour, remove the test sample and examine the paper described in paragraph 4(a) for evidence that any of the contents have leaked from the sample.



### Pass or Fail


**Fail**

**6** If an examination of the paper described in paragraph 4(a) discloses any trace of the contents of the test sample, the sample has failed the leakage test and a container of the same type as the test sample must not be used for a chemical product.



**Pass**

**7** If no trace of the contents of the test sample is found on the paper described in paragraph 4(a), the sample has passed the leakage test and a container of the same type as the test sample may be used for a chemical product.
