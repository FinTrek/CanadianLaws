- **(1)** Waste or other matter referred to in section 4 that contains any of the substances set out in column 1 of the table to that section at a concentration above the concentration set out in column 2, shall be assessed using three marine or estuarine biological tests for sediment assessment, namely, an acute lethality test and
	- **(a)** two sub-lethal tests; or
	- **(b)** one sub-lethal and one bioaccumulation test.

- **(2)** The acute lethality test shall be conducted using the test methodology entitled Biological Test Method: Reference Method for Determining Acute Lethality of Sediment to Marine or Estuarine Amphipods (Reference Method EPS 1/RM/35), December 1998, published by the Department of the Environment, as amended from time to time.

- **(3)** The sub-lethal tests shall be conducted using any of the test methodologies set out in Biological Test Method: Sublethal Toxicity Tests to Assess Sediments Intended for Disposal at Sea (Report; EPS 1/RM/40), May 2001, published by the Department of the Environment, as amended from time to time.

- **(4)** The bioaccumulation test shall be conducted using the test methodology entitled Guidance Manual: Bedded Sediment Bioaccumulation Tests (EPA/600/R-93/183), September 1993, published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as amended from time to time.

- **(5)** The tests shall be performed, and their results interpreted, in accordance with generally accepted standards of good scientific practice at the time the tests are performed.
> SOR/2003-295, s. 2.




**6** If the results of the three marine or estuarine biological tests set out in subsection 5(1) meet the criteria set out for those tests, the waste or other matter shall subsequently be considered to be below the Lower Level of the National Action List.



**7** If the results of either the acute lethality test set out in subsection 5(1) or the two other tests set out in paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b) fail to meet the criteria set out for those tests, the waste or other matter shall be considered to be above the Upper Level of the National Action List.



**8** If the results of the acute lethality test set out in subsection 5(1) and one of the tests set out in paragraph 5(1)(a) or (b) meet the criteria set out for those tests, the waste or other matter shall be considered to be below the Upper Level but above the Lower Level of the National Action List.
