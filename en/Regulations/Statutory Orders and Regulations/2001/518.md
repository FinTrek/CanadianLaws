Enabling authorities: 
- [AERONAUTICS ACT](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md)

Date registered: 22 November 2001

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 5.5(1)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), a copy of the proposed Goose Bay Airport Zoning Regulations, substantially in the form set out in the annexed regulations, was published in two successive issues of newspapers serving the area to which the proposed regulations relate, namely on March 19 and 26, 2001 in The Labradorian and in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I, on March 24 and 31, 2001, and a reasonable opportunity was afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of National Defence with respect to the proposed regulations;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1<br />

And Whereas the proposed regulations would prevent lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Goose Bay airport from being used or developed in a manner that is, in the opinion of the Minister of National Defence, incompatible with the safe operation of an airport or aircraft;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to paragraph 5.4(2)(b)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), hereby makes the annexed Goose Bay Airport Zoning Regulations.
