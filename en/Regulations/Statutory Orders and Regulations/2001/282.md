## Reduction of Judge’s Annuity

**8** If a judge who opted to receive a deferred annuity has made an election and subsequently opts to receive an immediate annuity, the reduction determined under section 7 shall be revised to take into account the new period during which the monthly instalments are to be reduced.
> SOR/2019-103, s. 2.





## Calculation of Enhanced Survivor Annuity


**9** If a judge makes an election, the amount of the monthly instalments of the enhanced survivor annuity is determined by converting the benefits described in paragraph (a) into the benefits described in paragraph (b), namely,
- **(a)** the annuity that was granted or paid to the judge and to which the survivor was entitled under Part I of the Act immediately before the election, the death benefit payable under subsection 51(3) of the Act and the benefits payable under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md),
into
- **(b)** the annuities described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv), the death benefit described in subparagraph (v), the death benefit payable under subsection 51(3) of the Act and the benefits payable under the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/S/S-24.md), namely,
	- **(i)** an annuity payable to the judge in monthly instalments for the duration of the marriage or cohabitation in a conjugal relationship, beginning on the later of the day on which the election takes effect or the day on which the annuity described in paragraph (a) becomes payable,
	- **(ii)** an annuity payable to the judge with monthly instalments equal to the monthly instalments that comprise the annuity that was granted or paid to the judge under Part I of the Act immediately before the election, beginning on the day on which the marriage or cohabitation in a conjugal relationship ceases,
	- **(iii)** an annuity payable to the survivor of the judge in monthly instalments, equal to the monthly instalments that comprise the annuity described in subsection 43.1(5) or section 44 of the Act, as the case may be, beginning on the day on which the judge dies, if the judge dies within the first year following the date on which the election takes effect,
	- **(iv)** an annuity payable to the survivor of the judge in monthly instalments during the life of the survivor equal to 60 per cent or 75 per cent, as elected by the judge, of the monthly instalments described in subparagraph (i), beginning on the day on which the judge dies, if the judge dies after the end of the first year following the day on which the election takes effect, and
	- **(v)** if the judge dies within the first year following the day on which the election takes effect, the monthly amounts corresponding to the reduction described in section 7, together with interest as set out in subsection 44.01(4) of the Act.
> SOR/2019-103, s. 3.





## Demographic Assumptions


**10** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), for the purposes of section 9, the following are the demographic assumptions on which the actuarial present values are to be based:
	- **(a)** the rates of mortality for any judge are the averages of the rates of mortality for judges receiving benefits in relation to a disability and judges receiving benefits other than in relation to a disability of the same age group as the judge, as set out in the actuarial valuation report most recently laid before Parliament in accordance with section 9 of the [Public Pensions Reporting Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2013%20(2nd%20Supp.).md), taking into account the mortality projection factors set out in that report, which averages are weighted in accordance with the benefits paid to judges in relation to a disability and to judges other than in relation to a disability;
	- **(b)** the rates of mortality for any survivor are those set out for spouses in the actuarial valuation report most recently laid before Parliament in accordance with section 9 of the [Public Pensions Reporting Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2013%20(2nd%20Supp.).md), taking into account the mortality projection factors set out in that report; and
	- **(c)** the rates of divorce are those established by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in accordance with the statistics on divorce published by Statistics Canada.

- **(2)** If a judge is less than 65 years of age, the demographic assumptions described in subsection (1) apply, except that the weights used for determining the average mortality rates of the judges shall be the same weights used for a judge aged 65.



**11** For the purpose of section 9, except as provided under subparagraph 9(b)(v), the rates of interest are,
- **(a)** for the first 15 years after the day on which the election takes effect, determined in accordance with the following formula, expressed as a percentage and rounded to the nearest one quarter per cent:
```
{[1 + ((m + 0.25)/200)]<sup>2</sup> - 1} × 100
```
where
- **m** represents the month-end value of the real rate of interest on long-term Government of Canada real return bonds (Series B114018), as published in the Bank of Canada’s *Weekly Financial Statistics*, in the second calendar month preceding the month in which the election takes effect; and
- **(b)** for subsequent years, 3.25%.




## Revision or Revocation of an Election


**12** 

- **(1)** If the Annuity Administrator becomes aware that a judge who has made an election has been sent any erroneous or misleading information in respect of the amount of the monthly instalments of the annuity described in subparagraph 9(b)(i) or the amount of the monthly instalments of the enhanced survivor annuity, the Annuity Administrator shall notify the judge of the corrected information by registered mail.

- **(2)** The judge may accept the revised amount or revoke the election by advising the Annuity Administrator to that effect by registered mail sent within 90 days after the day on which the Annuity Administrator’s notice is sent. If the judge does not advise the Annuity Administrator, he or she is deemed to have accepted the revised amount on the day following the ninetieth day after the sending of the Annuity Administrator’s notice.

- **(3)** If a judge accepts or is deemed to have accepted the revised amount, the reduction takes effect beginning on the day on which the election takes effect under the Act.

- **(4)** If a judge revokes the election, the reduction is discontinued beginning on the day on which the revocation is sent to the Annuity Administrator.

- **(5)** If a judge revokes the election within 12 months of the day on which the election took effect, the monthly amounts corresponding to the reduction described in section 7, together with interest as set out in subsection 44.01(4) of the Act, shall be repaid to the judge.
> SOR/2006-285, s. 2(F).





## Election Ceases to Have Effect


**13** 

- **(1)** An election ceases to have effect on the day on which the first of the following events occurs:
	- **(a)** in the case of an election in respect of a spouse
		- **(i)** the spouse dies,
		- **(ii)** the annulment of the marriage of the judge and the spouse takes effect, or
