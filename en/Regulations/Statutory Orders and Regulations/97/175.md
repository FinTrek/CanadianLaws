## Amount of Child Support



**Presumptive rule**

**3** 

- **(1)** Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, the amount of a child support order for children under the age of majority is
	- **(a)** the amount set out in the applicable table, according to the number of children under the age of majority to whom the order relates and the income of the spouse against whom the order is sought; and
	- **(b)** the amount, if any, determined under section 7.

**Child the age of majority or over**

- **(2)** Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, where a child to whom a child support order relates is the age of majority or over, the amount of the child support order is
	- **(a)** the amount determined by applying these Guidelines as if the child were under the age of majority; or
	- **(b)** if the court considers that approach to be inappropriate, the amount that it considers appropriate, having regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the child.

**Applicable table**

- **(3)** The applicable table is
	- **(a)** if the spouse against whom an order is sought resides in Canada,
		- **(i)** the table for the province in which that spouse ordinarily resides at the time the application for the child support order, or for a variation order in respect of a child support order, is made or the amount is to be recalculated under section 25.1 of the Act,
		- **(ii)** where the court is satisfied that the province in which that spouse ordinarily resides has changed since the time described in subparagraph (i), the table for the province in which the spouse ordinarily resides at the time of determining the amount of support, or
		- **(iii)** where the court is satisfied that, in the near future after determination of the amount of support, that spouse will ordinarily reside in a given province other than the province in which the spouse ordinarily resides at the time of that determination, the table for the given province; and
	- **(b)** if the spouse against whom an order is sought resides outside of Canada, or if the residence of that spouse is unknown, the table for the province where the other spouse ordinarily resides at the time the application for the child support order or for a variation order in respect of a child support order is made or the amount is to be recalculated under section 25.1 of the Act.
> SOR/97-563, s. 1.





**Incomes over $150,000**

**4** Where the income of the spouse against whom a child support order is sought is over $150,000, the amount of a child support order is
- **(a)** the amount determined under section 3; or
- **(b)** if the court considers that amount to be inappropriate,
	- **(i)** in respect of the first $150,000 of the spouse’s income, the amount set out in the applicable table for the number of children under the age of majority to whom the order relates;
	- **(ii)** in respect of the balance of the spouse’s income, the amount that the court considers appropriate, having regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children who are entitled to support and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the children; and
	- **(iii)** the amount, if any, determined under section 7.




**Spouse in place of a parent**

**5** Where the spouse against whom a child support order is sought stands in the place of a parent for a child, the amount of a child support order is, in respect of that spouse, such amount as the court considers appropriate, having regard to these Guidelines and any other parent’s legal duty to support the child.




**Medical and dental insurance**

**6** In making a child support order, where medical or dental insurance coverage for the child is available to either spouse through his or her employer or otherwise at a reasonable rate, the court may order that coverage be acquired or continued.




**Special or extraordinary expenses**

**7** 

- **(1)** In a child support order the court may, on either spouse’s request, provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of the following expenses, which expenses may be estimated, taking into account the necessity of the expense in relation to the child’s best interests and the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and those of the child and to the family’s spending pattern prior to the separation:
	- **(a)** child care expenses incurred as a result of the custodial parent’s employment, illness, disability or education or training for employment;
	- **(b)** that portion of the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the child;
	- **(c)** health-related expenses that exceed insurance reimbursement by at least $100 annually, including orthodontic treatment, professional counselling provided by a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or any other person, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and prescription drugs, hearing aids, glasses and contact lenses;
	- **(d)** extraordinary expenses for primary or secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the child’s particular needs;
	- **(e)** expenses for post-secondary education; and
	- **(f)** extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities.

**Sharing of expense**

- **(2)** The guiding principle in determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1) is that the expense is shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective incomes after deducting from the expense, the contribution, if any, from the child.

**Subsidies, tax deductions, etc.**

- **(3)** In determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1), the court must take into account any subsidies, benefits or income tax deductions or credits relating to the expense, and any eligibility to claim a subsidy, benefit or income tax deduction or credit relating to the expense.
> SOR/2000-337, s. 1; SOR/2000-390, s. 1(F).





**Split custody**

**8** Where each spouse has custody of one or more children, the amount of a child support order is the difference between the amount that each spouse would otherwise pay if a child support order were sought against each of the spouses.




**Shared custody**

**9** Where a spouse exercises a right of access to, or has physical custody of, a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course of a year, the amount of the child support order must be determined by taking into account
- **(a)** the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;
- **(b)** the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and
- **(c)** the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.




**Undue hardship**

**10** 

- **(1)** On either spouse’s application, a court may award an amount of child support that is different from the amount determined under any of sections 3 to 5, 8 or 9 if the court finds that the spouse making the request, or a child in respect of whom the request is made, would otherwise suffer undue hardship.

**Circumstances that may cause undue hardship**

- **(2)** Circumstances that may cause a spouse or child to suffer undue hardship include the following:
	- **(a)** the spouse has responsibility for an unusually high level of debts reasonably incurred to support the spouses and their children prior to the separation or to earn a living;
	- **(b)** the spouse has unusually high expenses in relation to exercising access to a child;
	- **(c)** the spouse has a legal duty under a judgment, order or written separation agreement to support any person;
	- **(d)** the spouse has a legal duty to support a child, other than a child of the marriage, who is
		- **(i)** under the age of majority, or
		- **(ii)** the age of majority or over but is unable, by reason of illness, disability or other cause, to obtain the necessaries of life; and
	- **(e)** the spouse has a legal duty to support any person who is unable to obtain the necessaries of life due to an illness or disability.

**Standards of living must be considered**

- **(3)** Despite a determination of undue hardship under subsection (1), an application under that subsection must be denied by the court if it is of the opinion that the household of the spouse who claims undue hardship would, after determining the amount of child support under any of sections 3 to 5, 8 or 9, have a higher standard of living than the household of the other spouse.

**Standards of living test**

- **(4)** In comparing standards of living for the purpose of subsection (3), the court may use the comparison of household standards of living test set out in Schedule II.

**Reasonable time**

- **(5)** Where the court awards a different amount of child support under subsection (1), it may specify, in the child support order, a reasonable time for the satisfaction of any obligation arising from circumstances that cause undue hardship and the amount payable at the end of that time.

**Reasons**

- **(6)** Where the court makes a child support order in a different amount under this section, it must record its reasons for doing so.




## Elements of a Child Support Order



**Form of payments**

**11** The court may require in a child support order that the amount payable under the order be paid in periodic payments, in a lump sum or in a lump sum and periodic payments.




**Security**

**12** The court may require in the child support order that the amount payable under the order be paid or secured, or paid and secured, in the manner specified in the order.




**Information to be specified in order**

**13** A child support order must include the following information:
- **(a)** the name and birth date of each child to whom the order relates;
- **(b)** the income of any spouse whose income is used to determine the amount of the child support order;
- **(c)** the amount determined under paragraph 3(1)(a) for the number of children to whom the order relates;
- **(d)** the amount determined under paragraph 3(2)(b) for a child the age of majority or over;
- **(e)** the particulars of any expense described in subsection 7(1), the child to whom the expense relates, and the amount of the expense or, where that amount cannot be determined, the proportion to be paid in relation to the expense; and
- **(f)** the date on which the lump sum or first payment is payable and the day of the month or other time period on which all subsequent payments are to be made.




## Variation of Child Support Orders



**Circumstances for variation**

**14** For the purposes of subsection 17(4) of the Act, any one of the following constitutes a change of circumstances that gives rise to the making of a variation order in respect of a child support order:
- **(a)** in the case where the amount of child support includes a determination made in accordance with the applicable table, any change in circumstances that would result in a different child support order or any provision thereof;
- **(b)** in the case where the amount of child support does not include a determination made in accordance with a table, any change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of either spouse or of any child who is entitled to support; and
- **(c)** in the case of an order made before May 1, 1997, the coming into force of section 15.1 of the Act, enacted by section 2 of chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, (1997).
> SOR/97-563, s. 2; SOR/2000-337, s. 2.





## Income



**Determination of annual income**

**15** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), a spouse’s annual income is determined by the court in accordance with sections 16 to 20.

**Agreement**

- **(2)** Where both spouses agree in writing on the annual income of a spouse, the court may consider that amount to be the spouse’s income for the purposes of these Guidelines if the court thinks that the amount is reasonable having regard to the income information provided under section 21.




**Calculation of annual income**

**16** Subject to sections 17 to 20, a spouse’s annual income is determined using the sources of income set out under the heading “Total income” in the T1 General form issued by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and is adjusted in accordance with Schedule III.
> SOR/2000-337, s. 3.





**Pattern of income**

**17** 

- **(1)** If the court is of the opinion that the determination of a spouse’s annual income under section 16 would not be the fairest determination of that income, the court may have regard to the spouse’s income over the last three years and determine an amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or receipt of a non-recurring amount during those years.

**Non-recurring losses**

- **(2)** Where a spouse has incurred a non-recurring capital or business investment loss, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the determination of the spouse’s annual income under section 16 would not provide the fairest determination of the annual income, choose not to apply sections 6 and 7 of Schedule III, and adjust the amount of the loss, including related expenses and carrying charges and interest expenses, to arrive at such amount as the court considers appropriate.
> SOR/2000-337, s. 4.





**Shareholder, director or officer**

**18** 

- **(1)** Where a spouse is a shareholder, director or officer of a corporation and the court is of the opinion that the amount of the spouse’s annual income as determined under section 16 does not fairly reflect all the money available to the spouse for the payment of child support, the court may consider the situations described in section 17 and determine the spouse’s annual income to include
	- **(a)** all or part of the pre-tax income of the corporation, and of any corporation that is related to that corporation, for the most recent taxation year; or
	- **(b)** an amount commensurate with the services that the spouse provides to the corporation, provided that the amount does not exceed the corporation’s pre-tax income.

**Adjustment to corporation’s pre-tax income**

- **(2)** In determining the pre-tax income of a corporation for the purposes of subsection (1), all amounts paid by the corporation as salaries, wages or management fees, or other payments or benefits, to or on behalf of persons with whom the corporation does not deal at arm’s length must be added to the pre-tax income, unless the spouse establishes that the payments were reasonable in the circumstances.




**Imputing income**

**19** 

- **(1)** The court may impute such amount of income to a spouse as it considers appropriate in the circumstances, which circumstances include the following:
	- **(a)** the spouse is intentionally under-employed or unemployed, other than where the under-employment or unemployment is required by the needs of a child of the marriage or any child under the age of majority or by the reasonable educational or health needs of the spouse;
	- **(b)** the spouse is exempt from paying federal or provincial income tax;
	- **(c)** the spouse lives in a country that has effective rates of income tax that are significantly lower than those in Canada;
	- **(d)** it appears that income has been diverted which would affect the level of child support to be determined under these Guidelines;
	- **(e)** the spouse’s property is not reasonably utilized to generate income;
	- **(f)** the spouse has failed to provide income information when under a legal obligation to do so;
	- **(g)** the spouse unreasonably deducts expenses from income;
	- **(h)** the spouse derives a significant portion of income from dividends, capital gains or other sources that are taxed at a lower rate than employment or business income or that are exempt from tax; and
	- **(i)** the spouse is a beneficiary under a trust and is or will be in receipt of income or other benefits from the trust.

**Reasonableness of expenses**

- **(2)** For the purpose of paragraph (1)(g), the reasonableness of an expense deduction is not solely governed by whether the deduction is permitted under the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md).
> SOR/2000-337, s. 5.





**Non-resident**

**20** Where a spouse is a non-resident of Canada, the spouse's annual income is determined as though the spouse were a resident of Canada.

### **SCHEDULE I** 
**(Subsection 2(1))**
## Federal Child Support Tables
*Notes:*


**1** *The federal child support tables set out the amount of monthly child support payments for each province on the basis of the annual income of the spouse ordered to pay child support (the “support payer”) and the number of children for whom a table amount is payable. Refer to these Guidelines to determine whether special measures apply.*


**2** *There is a threshold level of income below which no amount of child support is payable. Child support amounts are specified for incomes up to $150,000 per year. Refer to section 4 of these Guidelines to determine the amount of child support payments for support payers with annual incomes over $150,000.*


**3** *Income is set out in the tables in intervals of $1,000. Monthly amounts are determined by adding the basic amount and the amount calculated by multiplying the applicable percentage by the portion of the income that exceeds the lower amount within that interval of income.*


*Example:*


*Province: British Columbia*


*Number of children: 2*


*Annual income of support payer: $33,760*


*Basic amount: $480*


*Percentage: 1.20%*


*Lower amount of the income interval: $33,000*


*The amount of monthly child support is calculated as follows:*


*$480 + [1.2% × ($33,760 - 33,000)]*


*$480 + [1.2/100 × $760]*


*$480 + [0.012 × $760]*


*$480 + $9.12 = $489.12*


**4** *There are separate tables for each province. The amounts vary from one province to another because of differences in provincial income tax rates. The tables are in the following order:*


**(a)** *Ontario;*


**(b)** *Quebec;*


**(c)** *Nova Scotia;*


**(d)** *New Brunswick;*


**(e)** *Manitoba;*


**(f)** *British Columbia;*


**(g)** *Prince Edward Island;*


**(h)** *Saskatchewan;*


**(i)** *Alberta;*


**(j)** *Newfoundland;*


**(k)** *Yukon;*


**(l)** *Northwest Territories; and*


**(m)** *Nunavut.*


**5** *The amounts in the tables are based on economic studies of average spending on children in families at different income levels in Canada. They are calculated on the basis that child support payments are no longer taxable in the hands of the receiving parent and no longer deductible by the paying parent. They are calculated using a mathematical formula and generated by a computer program.*


**6** *The formula referred to in note 5 sets support amounts to reflect average expenditures on children by a spouse with a particular number of children and level of income. The calculation is based on the support payer’s income. The formula uses the basic personal amount for non-refundable tax credits to recognize personal expenses, and takes other federal and provincial income taxes and credits into account. Federal Child Tax benefits and Goods and Services Tax credits for children are excluded from the calculation. At lower income levels, the formula sets the amounts to take into account the combined impact of taxes and child support payments on the support payer’s limited disposable income.*

**Test**

**2** The comparison of household standards of living test is as follows:**STEP 1**

Establish the annual income of each person in each household by applying the formula
```
A - B
```
where
- **A** is the person's income determined under sections 15 to 20 of these Guidelines, and
- **B** is the federal and provincial taxes payable on the person's taxable income.

Where the information on which to base the income determination is not provided, the court may impute income in the amount it considers appropriate.

**STEP 2**

Adjust the annual income of each person in each household by

**(a)** deducting the following amounts, calculated on an annual basis:

**(i)** any amount relied on by the court as a factor that resulted in a determination of undue hardship, except any amount attributable to the support of a member of the household that is not incurred due to a disability or serious illness of that member,



**(ii)** the amount that would otherwise be payable by the person in respect of a child to whom the order relates, if the pleading of undue hardship was not made,

**(A)** under the applicable table, or



**(B)** as is considered by the court to be appropriate, where the court considers the table amount to be inappropriate,

**(A)** an amount already deducted under subparagraph (i), and



**(B)** an amount paid by the person in respect of a child to whom the order referred to in subparagraph (ii) relates; and





**(b)** adding the following amounts, calculated on an annual basis:

**(A)** under the applicable table, or



**(B)** as is considered by the court to be appropriate, where the court considers the table amount to be inappropriate,





**(ii)** any amount of child support that the person has received for any child under a judgment, order or written separation agreement.



*STEP 3*

Add the amounts of adjusted annual income for all the persons in each household to determine the total household income for each household.

*STEP 4*

Determine the applicable low-income measures amount for each household based on the following:

*STEP 5*

Divide the household income amount (Step 3) by the low-income measures amount (Step 4) to get a household income ratio for each household.

*STEP 6*

Compare the household income ratios. The household that has the higher ratio has the higher standard of living.
