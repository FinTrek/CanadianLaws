Whereas the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United States, of October 21, 1976 (28 U.S.C.) does not accord immunity to an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state that is a separate legal person, unless a majority of its shares or other ownership interest is owned by the foreign state or a political subdivision of the foreign state;
