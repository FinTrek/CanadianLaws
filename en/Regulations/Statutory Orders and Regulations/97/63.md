## Originating Goods


**2** 

- **(1)** Except as otherwise provided in these Regulations, a good originates in a CIFTA country where
	- **(a)** the good is
		- **(i)** a mineral good extracted in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries,
		- **(ii)** a vegetable or other good harvested in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries,
		- **(iii)** a live animal born and raised in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries,
		- **(iv)** a good obtained from hunting, trapping or fishing in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries,
		- **(v)** a fish, shellfish or other marine life taken from the sea by a vessel registered or recorded with a CIFTA country and flying that country’s flag,
		- **(vi)** a good produced on board a factory ship from a good referred to in subparagraph (v), where that factory ship is registered or recorded with a CIFTA country and flies that country’s flag,
		- **(vii)** a good taken by a CIFTA country or a person of a CIFTA country from or beneath the seabed outside the territorial waters of that country, where a CIFTA country has the right to exploit that seabed,
		- **(viii)** a good taken from outer space, where the good is obtained by a CIFTA country or a person of a CIFTA country and does not undergo production outside the territory of any of the CIFTA countries,
		- **(ix)** waste and scrap derived from
			- **(A)** production in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries, or
			- **(B)** used goods collected in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries, where those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials, or
		- **(x)** a good produced in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries exclusively from a good referred to in any of subparagraphs (i) through (ix), or from its derivatives, at any stage of production;
	- **(b)** each non-originating material used in the production of the good undergoes a change in tariff classification specified in the rule set out in Schedule I for the tariff provision under which the good is classified, and the good satisfies any other applicable requirement specified in that rule, as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries;
	- **(c)** the good satisfies, as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the CIFTA countries, the applicable requirements specified in the rule set out in Schedule I for the tariff provision under which the good is classified, where no change in tariff classification is specified in that rule;

		- **(i)** the heading under which the good is classified provides for both the good and its parts and is not further subdivided into subheadings, or
		- **(ii)** the subheading under which the good is classified provides for both the good and its parts,
and at least one category of identical or similar materials of that heading or subheading consists entirely of originating materials.

- **(2)** For the purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good under paragraph (1)(e),
	- **(a)** only those parts that are classified under the same heading, subheading or tariff item as the good shall be considered as parts for the purposes of determining whether at least one category of identical or similar materials consists entirely of originating materials; and

### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(Subsection 4(3))**
## Methods for Determining the Value of Non-Originating Materials Where Identical Materials or Fungible Materials Are Used in the Production of the Good

### Interpretation

**1** The definitions in this section apply in this Schedule.

***FIFO method*** means the method by which the value of non-originating materials, determined in accordance with subsection 4(2) of these Regulations, first received in materials inventory, is considered to be the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good first shipped to the buyer of the good. (*méthode PEPS*)

***LIFO method*** means the method by which the value of non-originating materials, determined in accordance with subsection 4(2) of these Regulations, last received in materials inventory, is considered to be the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good first shipped to the buyer of the good. (*méthode DEPS*)

***materials inventory*** means, with respect to a single plant of the producer of a good, an inventory of non-originating materials that are identical materials or fungible materials and that are used in the production of the good. (*stock de matières*)

***rolling average method*** means the method by which the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a good that is shipped to the buyer of the good is based on the average value, calculated in accordance with section 4, of the non-originating materials in materials inventory. (*méthode de la moyenne mobile*)



### General

**2** The methods for determining the value of non-originating materials that are identical materials or fungible materials and that are referred to in subsection 4(3) of these Regulations are the following:
- **a)** FIFO method;
- **b)** LIFO method; and
- **c)** rolling average method.


**3** 

- **(1)** Where a producer of a good chooses, with respect to non-originating materials that are identical materials or fungible materials, any of the methods referred to in section 2, the producer may not use another of those methods with respect to any other non-originating materials that are identical materials or fungible materials, as the case may be, and that are used in the production of that good or in the production of any other good with respect to which a calculation under subsection 4(1) of these Regulations has been made.

- **(2)** Where a producer of a good produces the good in more than one plant, the method chosen by the producer shall be used with respect to all plants of the producer in which the good is produced.

- **(3)** The method chosen by the producer to determine the value of non-originating materials may be chosen at any time during the producer’s fiscal year and may not be changed during that fiscal year.



### Average Value for Rolling Average Method

**4** 

- **(1)** The average value of non-originating materials that are identical materials or fungible materials and that are used in the production of a good that is shipped to the buyer of the good is calculated by dividing
	- **a)** the total value of non-originating materials that are identical materials or fungible materials, as the case may be, and that were in materials inventory before the shipment of the good, determined in accordance with subsection 4(2) of these Regulations,
by
	- **b)** the total units of those non-originating materials in materials inventory prior to the shipment of the good.

- **(2)** The average value calculated under subsection (1) is applied to the remaining units of non-originating materials in materials inventory.





### **SCHEDULE III** 
**(Section 9)**
## Inventory Management Methods

**PART I** 
## Fungible Materials


### Interpretation

**1** The definitions in this section apply in this Part.

***average method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under section 4, of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory. (*méthode de la moyenne*)

***FIFO method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible materials first received in materials inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory. (*méthode PEPS*)

***LIFO method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible materials last received in materials inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory. (*méthode DEPS*)

***materials inventory*** means
- **(a)** with respect to a producer of a good, an inventory of fungible materials that are used in the production of the good; and
- **(b)** with respect to a person from whom the producer of the good acquired those fungible materials, an inventory from which fungible materials are sold or otherwise transferred to the producer of the good. (*stock de matières*)

***opening inventory*** means the materials inventory at the time an inventory management method is chosen. (*stock d’ouverture*)

***origin identifier*** means any mark that identifies fungible materials as originating materials or non-originating materials. (*identificateur d’origine*)



### General

**2** 

- **(1)** The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible materials referred to in paragraph 9(a) of these Regulations are originating materials are the following:

	- **(b)** FIFO method;
	- **(c)** LIFO method; and
	- **(d)** average method.

- **(2)** Where a producer of a good or a person from whom the producer acquired the materials that are used in the production of the good chooses an inventory management method referred to in subsection (1), that method, including the averaging period chosen in the case of the average method, shall be used from the time the choice is made until the end of the fiscal year of the producer or person.



### Specific Identification Method

**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), where the producer or person referred to in subsection 2(2) chooses the specific identification method, the producer or person shall physically segregate, in materials inventory, originating materials that are fungible materials from non-originating materials that are fungible materials.

- **(2)** Where originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials are marked with an origin identifier, the producer or person need not physically segregate those materials under subsection (1) if the origin identifier remains visible throughout the production of the good.



### Average Method

**4** 

- **(1)** Where the producer or person referred to in subsection 2(2) chooses the average method, the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory that is calculated under subsections (2) and (3).

- **(2)** The ratio is calculated with respect to a one-month or three-month period, at the choice of the producer or person, by dividing
	- **(a)** the sum of
		- **(i)** the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
		- **(ii)** the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding period,
by
	- **(b)** the sum of
		- **(i)** the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
		- **(ii)** the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding period.

- **(3)** The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding one-month or three-month period under subsection (2) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at the end of that period.



### Manner of Dealing with Opening Inventory

**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (2) and (3), where the producer or person referred to in subsection 2(2) has fungible materials in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible materials is determined by
	- **(a)** identifying, in the books of the producer or person, the latest receipts of fungible materials that add up to the amount of fungible materials in opening inventory;
	- **(b)** determining the origin of the fungible materials that make up those receipts; and
	- **(c)** considering the origin of those fungible materials to be the origin of the fungible materials in opening inventory.

- **(2)** Where the producer or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible materials is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.

- **(3)** The producer or person may consider all fungible materials in opening inventory to be non-originating materials.
