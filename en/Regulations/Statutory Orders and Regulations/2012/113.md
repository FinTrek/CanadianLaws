### Rate of Return of the Project


**6** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of subsection 247(2) of the Act, the rate of return in respect of the project that would have been obtained on behalf of Her Majesty in right of the Province is equal to the interest rate that would make the net present value of the provincial cash flow, calculated over the life of the project beginning on the conversion date, equal to zero.

- **(2)** The provincial cash flow for a year is equal to the amount determined by the following formula:

where
- **A** is the Provincial Crown share;
- **B** <sub>1</sub>is the gross revenues of the project for the year determined under section 8;
- **C** <sub>1</sub>is the sum, for the year, of the project operating and capital costs, as specified in the development plan approved in respect of the project under section 143 of the Act converted to current dollars using the forecasted Canadian gross domestic product (GDP) deflator in that year, and the project royalties that would be payable under the Offshore Petroleum Royalty Act; and
- **D** <sub>1</sub>is the sum, for the year, of the acquisition payment determined under subsection 10(1) and the income tax payable.

- **(3)** The calculation made under subsection (2) shall be based on the mean production scenario provided in the development plan.

- **(a)** in the case of NGL or crude oil, the forecast WTI crude oil price at Cushing in constant US dollars per cubic metre; or
- **(b)** in the case of natural gas, the forecast natural gas price at Henry Hub in constant US dollars per gigajoule;

2.5 × A × H × [1 + 0.01n]
```
where
- **A** is the Provincial Crown share; and
- **H** is 25% of the eligible costs and expenses in respect of which an incentive was made under the Petroleum Incentive Program Act chapter 107 of the Statutes of Canada, 1980–81–82–83, and which have not already been considered in the calculation of a Crown share adjustment payment in respect of another project; and
