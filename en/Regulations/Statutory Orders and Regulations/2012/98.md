### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 1 and 2)**
In this schedule, all grid coordinates are in metres (m) and refer to the 1983 North American Datum, Zone 18, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. Grid coordinates have been computed using a combined average scale factor of 0.9996563.


In this schedule, all elevation values are in metres (m) and are based on the Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum (CGVD28).



**PART 1** 
## Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan, is the geometric centre of the runway thresholds, at grid coordinates 7 123 555.931 N, 426 034.620 E (latitude 64°13′49″ N, longitude 76°31′30″ W). It is located on the centre line of the strip surface at a distance of 668.70 m from the end of the strip surface associated with runway 13-31, and its assigned elevation is 46.72 m above sea level.



**PART 2** 
## Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, as shown on the zoning plan, are described as follows:

(a) an imaginary inclined surface abutting the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 13 and ascending, from an assigned elevation of 46.57 m above sea level, at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally, to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip surface and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line and 83.33 m above the assigned elevation at the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 13; and



(b) an imaginary inclined surface abutting the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 31 and ascending, from an assigned elevation of 42.26 m above sea level, at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally, to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip surface and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line and 83.33 m above the assigned elevation at the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 31.




The elevation of an approach surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of that approach surface. The elevation of an approach surface centre line is calculated from the elevation of the abutting end of the strip surface, and increases at the constant ratios set out in this Part.



**PART 3** 
## Outer Surface

The outer surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary surface extending outward from the airport reference point to a radius of 4 000 m. It is situated at a constant elevation of 45 m above the airport reference point, but at 9 m above the ground when that elevation would place the outer surface at less than 9 m above the ground.



**PART 4** 
## Strip Surface

The elevation of a strip surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of that strip surface. The elevation of the strip surface centre line between the strip surface end and the closest strip surface threshold is equal to the elevation of the strip surface end. The strip surface centre line between the strip surface thresholds is divided into segments, each of which has a slope that increases or decreases at the constant ratio set out in Column 7 of the table to this Part. The elevation of any point along a segment is calculated using the data set out in that table.


The strip surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary rectangular surface described as follows:

the strip surface associated with runway 13-31 is 90 m in total width, being 45 m on either side of the centre line of the runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the northwest of threshold 13 and ends 60 m to the southeast of threshold 31, having a total length of 1 337.40 m. The 13 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 46.57 m and the 31 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 42.26 m. The azimuth of the centre line of runway 13-31 is S 51°10′07″ E. Threshold 13 has grid coordinates of 7 123 937.47 N and 425 560.61 E, and threshold 31 has grid coordinates of 7 123 174.39 N and 426 508.63 E.

**PART 5** 
## Transitional Surfaces

Each transitional surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary inclined surface ascending at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip surface, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces to the intersection with the outer surface.


The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting a strip surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of the abutting strip surface. The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting an approach surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of the abutting approach surface.



**PART 6** 
## Limit of Area Containing Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The limit of the area containing the lands to which these Regulations apply is defined by a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan.
