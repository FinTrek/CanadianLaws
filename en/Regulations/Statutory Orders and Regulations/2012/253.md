## Fee Adjustments



**Adjustment factors — subparagraph 1(a)(i) of schedule**

**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (4), the fee set out in subparagraph 1(a)(i) of the schedule is to be adjusted in accordance with this section in respect of each fiscal year to take into account
	- **(a)** any variation in the external cost incurred by Passport Canada to send passports and other travel documents in Canada by mail or courier;
	- **(b)** any variation in the amounts incurred by Passport Canada that are payable to a government body, including a Crown corporation, for exercising any of the administrative powers listed in subsection 12(1) of the [Canadian Passport Order](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Instruments/81/86.md).

**Adjustment calculation**

- **(2)** Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the amount of the adjustment in respect of a given fiscal year is calculated during the preceding fiscal year and is the positive or negative amount, as the case may be, determined by the formula
```
[(A/B - C/D) x B/E] + [(F/G - H/I) x G/E] + J
```
where
- **A** is the total external cost incurred by Passport Canada to send passports and other travel documents in Canada by mail or courier in the reference year, in constant dollars;
- **B** is the total number of passports and other travel documents sent by Passport Canada by mail or courier in Canada in the reference year;
- **C** is the total external cost incurred by Passport Canada to send passports and other travel documents by mail or courier in Canada in the fiscal year preceding the reference year, in constant dollars;
- **D** is the total number of passports and other travel documents sent by Passport Canada by mail or courier in Canada in the fiscal year preceding the reference year;
- **E** is the total number of passports and other travel documents issued by Passport Canada in Canada in the reference year;
- **F** is the total external cost incurred by Passport Canada for the exercise of its administrative powers by other government bodies in the reference year, in constant dollars;
- **G** is the total number of passports issued by Passport Canada in Canada in the reference year as a result of passport applications received by other government bodies;
- **H** is the total external cost incurred by Passport Canada for the exercise of its administrative powers by other government bodies in the fiscal year preceding the reference year, in constant dollars;
- **I** is the total number of passports issued by Passport Canada in Canada in the fiscal year preceding the reference year as a result of passport applications received by other government bodies; and
- **J** is the total amount of all adjustments that would have been made since the base year, but for the application of subsection (4).

**Rounding up**

- **(3)** If the adjustment calculation results in a fraction of a dollar, the amount of the adjustment is to be rounded up to the nearest dollar.

**Exception**

- **(4)** There is to be no fee adjustment in respect of a given fiscal year if the adjustment calculation for that year, prior to rounding up, results in an amount greater than -$1 but less than $1.




**Adjustment calculations — subparagraph 1(a)(ii), paragraph 2(a) and items 3 to 6 of schedule**

**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), when the fee set out in subparagraph 1(a)(i) of the schedule is adjusted for a given fiscal year, the following adjustments are also made for that fiscal year:
	- **(a)** the fees set out in subparagraph 1(a)(ii) and item 5 of the schedule are adjusted to an amount representing 70% of the fee set out in subparagraph 1(a)(i) of the schedule as adjusted in accordance with section 4;
	- **(b)** the fees set out in paragraph 2(a) and item 6 of the schedule are adjusted to an amount representing 60% of the fee set out in subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of the schedule as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a);
	- **(c)** the fee set out in item 3 of the schedule is adjusted by the same amount as the fee set out in subparagraph 1(a)(i) of the schedule; and
	- **(d)** the fee set out in item 4 of the schedule is adjusted to an amount representing 60% of the fee set out in item 3 of the schedule, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c).

**Rounding up**

- **(2)** If an adjustment calculation results in a fee that includes a fraction of a dollar, the resulting fee is to be rounded up to the nearest dollar.




**Adjustment factors — subparagraph 1(b)(i) of schedule**

**6** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (4), the fee set out in subparagraph 1(b)(i) of the schedule is to be adjusted in accordance with this section in respect of each fiscal year to take into account
	- **(a)** any variation in the external cost incurred by Passport Canada to send passports outside Canada by mail or courier; and
	- **(b)** any variation in the amounts incurred by Passport Canada for the delivery of the passport program outside Canada.

**Adjustment calculation**

- **(2)** Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the amount of the adjustment in respect of a given fiscal year is calculated during the preceding fiscal year and is the positive or negative amount, as the case may be, determined by the formula
```
[(A/B - C/D) x B/E] + [(F/G - H/I) x G/E] + J
```
where
- **A** is the total external cost incurred by Passport Canada to send passports by mail or courier outside Canada in the reference year, in constant dollars;

- **G** is the total number of passports issued by Passport Canada outside Canada in the reference year as a result of passport applications received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade;
- **H** is the total external cost incurred by Passport Canada for the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to deliver the passport program outside Canada in the fiscal year preceding the reference year, in constant dollars;
- **I** is the total number of passports issued by Passport Canada outside Canada in the fiscal year preceding the reference year as a result of passport applications received by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade; and
- **J** is the total amount of all adjustments that would have been made since the base year, but for the application of subsection (4).

**Rounding up**

- **(3)** If an adjustment calculation results in a fraction of a dollar, the adjustment is to be rounded up to the nearest dollar.

**Exception**

- **(4)** There is to be no fee adjustment in respect of a given fiscal year if the adjustment calculation for that year, prior to rounding up, results in an amount greater than -$3 but less than $3.




**Adjustment calculations — subparagraph 1(b)(ii) and paragraph 2(b) of schedule**

**7** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), when the fee set out in subparagraph 1(b)(i) of the schedule is adjusted for a given fiscal year, the following adjustments are also made for that fiscal year:
	- **(a)** the fee set out in subparagraph 1(b)(ii) of the schedule is adjusted to an amount representing 70% of the fee set out in subparagraph 1(b)(i) of the schedule as adjusted in accordance with section 6; and
	- **(b)** the fee set out in paragraph 2(b) of the schedule is adjusted to an amount representing 60% of the fee set out in subparagraph 1(b)(ii) of the schedule as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a).

**Rounding up**

- **(2)** If an adjustment calculation results in a fee that includes a fraction of a dollar, the resulting fee is to be rounded up to the nearest dollar.




**Interpretation**

**8** For the purpose of sections 4 to 7, the fees set out in subparagraphs 1(a)(i) and (b)(i) of the schedule are the fees set out in those provisions as previously adjusted, as applicable, in accordance with these Regulations.




**Constant Dollars**

**9** For the purposes of subsections 4(2) and 6(2), the amount of the external cost, in constant dollars, for a given fiscal year, is determined by the following formula:
```
A × 1.02<sup>–B</sup>
```
where
- **A** is the amount of the external cost, in current dollars; and
- **B** is the difference in the number of years between
- **(a)** the reference year and the base year, in the case of elements A and F of the formulas set out in subsections 4(2) and 6(2); or
- **(b)** the year preceding the reference year and the base year, in the case of elements C and H of the formulas set out in those subsections.




**Same fees**

**10** For greater certainty, if a fee adjustment is made in accordance with these Regulations, the fees for a subsequent fiscal year in respect of which no adjustment is made remain the fees resulting from the last adjustment.

**11**
