### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 1 and 2)**
In this schedule, all grid coordinates are in metres (m) and refer to the 1983 North American Datum, Zone 16, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. Grid coordinates have been computed using a combined average scale factor of 0.99975895.


In this schedule, all elevation values are in metres (m) and are based on the Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum (CGVD28).



**PART 1** 
## Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan, is the geometric centre of the runway thresholds, at grid coordinates 7 605 223.935 N, 385 471.969 E (latitude 68°32′09″ N, longitude 89°48′19″ W). It is located on the centre line of the strip surface at a distance of 823.55 m from the end of the strip surface associated with runway 05-23, and its assigned elevation is 10.63 m above sea level.



**PART 2** 
## Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, as shown on the zoning plan, are described as follows:

(a) an imaginary inclined surface abutting the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 05 and ascending, from an assigned elevation of 17.70 m above sea level, at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip surface and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 280 m from the projected centre line and 100 m above the assigned elevation at the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 05; and



(b) an imaginary inclined surface abutting the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 23 and ascending, from an assigned elevation of 8.32 m above sea level, at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 25 m measured horizontally, to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip surface and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip surface; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 280 m from the projected centre line and 100 m above the assigned elevation at the end of the strip surface associated with runway approach 23.




The elevation of an approach surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of that approach surface. The elevation of an approach surface centre line is calculated from the elevation of the abutting end of the strip surface, and increases at the constant ratios set out in this Part.



**PART 3** 
## Outer Surface

The outer surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary surface extending outward from the airport reference point to a radius of 4 000 m. It is situated at a constant elevation of 45 m above the airport reference point, but at 9 m above the ground when that elevation would place the outer surface at less than 9 m above the ground.



**PART 4** 
## Strip Surface

The elevation of a strip surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of that strip surface. The elevation of the strip surface centre line between the strip surface end and the closest strip surface threshold is equal to the elevation of the strip surface end. The strip surface centre line between the strip surface thresholds is divided into segments, each of which has a slope that increases or decreases at the constant ratio set out in Column 7 of the table to this Part. The elevation of any point along a segment is calculated using the data set out in that table.


The strip surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary rectangular surface described as follows:

the strip surface associated with runway 05-23 is 60 m in total width, being 30 m on either side of the centre line of the runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the southwest of threshold 05 and ends 60 m to the northeast of threshold 23, having a total length of 1 647.10 m. The 05 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 17.70 m and the 23 end of the strip surface has an elevation of 8.32 m. The azimuth of the centre line of runway 05-23 is N 51°11′57″ E. Threshold 05 has grid coordinates of 7 604 745.60 N and 384 877.06 E, and threshold 23 has grid coordinates of 7 605 702.27 N and 386 066.88 E.

**PART 5** 
## Transitional Surfaces

Each transitional surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary inclined surface ascending at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip surface, extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces to the intersection with the outer surface.


The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting a strip surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of the abutting strip surface. The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting an approach surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of the abutting approach surface.



**PART 6** 
## Limit of Area Containing Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The limit of the area containing the lands to which these Regulations apply is defined by a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point, as shown on the zoning plan.
