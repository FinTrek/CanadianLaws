**Reinsurance by company**

**10** An approved mortgage insurer that caused itself, before the day on which these Regulations come into force, to be reinsured by a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Act against a risk that it had undertaken under its contracts of insurance may, despite paragraph 4(a), continue to be reinsured against that risk by that company for a period of no more than three years beginning on the day on which these Regulations come into force.
