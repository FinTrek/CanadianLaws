## Application



**Application**

**2** 

- **(1)** These Regulations apply in respect of a wastewater system that, when it deposits effluent via its final discharge point, deposits a deleterious substance prescribed in section 5 in water or a place referred to in subsection 36(3) of the Act and that
	- **(a)** is designed to collect an average daily volume of 100 m<sup>3</sup> or more of influent; or
	- **(b)** during any calendar year, collects an average daily volume of 100 m<sup>3</sup> or more of influent.

**Annual exceptions**

- **(2)** Despite paragraph (1)(a), these Regulations do not, for the subsequent calendar year, apply in respect of a wastewater system referred to in that paragraph that, during a calendar year, collected an average daily volume of less than 100 m<sup>3</sup> of influent.

**Non‑applica­tion — areas**

- **(3)** These Regulations do not apply in respect of a wastewater system located
	- **(a)** in the Northwest Territories;
	- **(b)** in Nunavut; or
	- **(c)** north of the 54th parallel in Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador.

**Non‑applica­tion — industrial, commercial or institutional influent**

- **(4)** These Regulations do not apply in respect of a wastewater system that is located on the site of an industrial, commercial or institutional facility if the wastewater system is designed to collect influent whose volume consists of less than 50% blackwater and greywater combined.

**Non‑applica­tion — pulp and paper mills**

- **(5)** These Regulations do not apply in respect of a mill as defined in section 2 of the [Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/92/269.md).




**Types of wastewater systems**

**3** For the purpose of these Regulations, there are two types of wastewater systems, as follows:
- **(a)** an intermittent wastewater system, namely, one with a hydraulic retention time of at least 90 days that deposits effluent via its final discharge point during at most four periods per calendar year, each of which is separated from every other period by at least seven clear days during which no deposit occurs; and
- **(b)** a continuous wastewater system, namely, any wastewater system other than an intermittent wastewater system.




**Consolidated wastewater systems**

**4** 

- **(1)** If an owner of at least 10 wastewater systems — none of which treats its wastewater in a manner that would permit the deposit of effluent via its final discharge point that meets the condition set out in paragraph 6(1)(a) or (b) (referred to in these Regulations as an “original wastewater system”) — plans to consolidate those original wastewater systems into one or more wastewater systems (referred to in these Regulations as a “planned consolidated wastewater system”), the original wastewater systems that constitute each of those planned consolidated wastewater systems are, on the receipt by an authorization officer of a consolidation plan referred to in subsection (3), deemed to be a single wastewater system (referred to in these Regulations as a “fictional consolidated wastewater system”).

**Final discharge point**

- **(2)** The final discharge point for each fictional consolidated wastewater system is deemed to be the final discharge point of the original wastewater system — among all of the original wastewater systems that constitute that fictional consolidated wastewater system — that is allocated the greatest number of points under the table to Schedule 2.

**Consolidation plan**

- **(3)** The consolidation plan must contain the following information:
	- **(a)** a description of the modifications to be made to each of the original wastewater systems so that the effluent deposited via the final discharge point for the planned consolidated wastewater system is not acutely lethal and meets the conditions for authorization set out in paragraphs 6(1)(a) and (b), along with a schedule for implementation of the plan;
	- **(b)** a statement identifying the final discharge point of each of the original wastewater systems that are, under the plan, to be eliminated, including the information referred to in paragraph 18(1)(e) for each of those final discharge points; and

**7** 

- **(1)** The owner or operator of a wastewater system must, for each calendar year, calculate the average daily volume of effluent deposited via the system’s final discharge point by
	- **(a)** determining, in accordance with subsection (2), for each day during that calendar year when effluent was deposited, the volume of effluent deposited via the final discharge point, expressed in m<sup>3</sup>;
	- **(b)** calculating the sum of the daily volumes of effluent referred to in paragraph (a); and
	- **(c)** dividing that sum by the number of days in that calendar year.

**Daily volumes**

- **(2)** The volume of effluent during each day referred to in paragraph (1)(a) must be determined
	- **(a)** for an intermittent wastewater system,
		- **(i)** by using monitoring equipment referred to in section 9 that provides
			- **(A)** a continuous measure of the volume of influent, or effluent deposited via the final discharge point, during that day, or
			- **(B)** a measure of the rate of flow of the influent or that effluent upon which that daily volume may be estimated, or
		- **(ii)** by using a method of estimation in accordance with subsection (4);
	- **(b)** for a continuous wastewater system, by using monitoring equipment referred to in section 9 that provides
		- **(i)** a continuous measure of the volume of influent, or effluent deposited via the final discharge point, during that day, if the average daily volume of effluent deposited via the final discharge point during the previous calendar year was more than 2 500 m<sup>3</sup>, and
		- **(ii)** a continuous measure of that volume or a measure of the rate of flow of that influent or effluent upon which that daily volume of effluent may be estimated, in any other case.

**Estimate of daily volume based on measured rate of flow**

- **(3)** The estimation of the volume of effluent deposited during a day referred to in paragraph (1)(a) based on a measured rate of flow, referred to in clause (2)(a)(i)(B) or subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), is to be done as follows:
	- **(a)** measure the rate of flow of influent, or effluent deposited via the final discharge point, in any chosen unit of volume for any chosen unit of time; and
	- **(b)** calculate that volume based on that rate of flow for the duration of the deposits of effluent made on that day and, if applicable, convert it to m<sup>3</sup>.

**Method of estimation — intermittent wastewater systems**

- **(4)** The owner or operator of an intermittent wastewater system who has established a method of estimation of the volume of effluent must ensure that it is based on generally accepted engineering practices and use it to estimate the daily volume of effluent deposited via the final discharge point with a margin of error of ±15%.
