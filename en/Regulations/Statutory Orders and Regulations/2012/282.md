> SOR/2016-10, s. 1.





## Application



**No pre-existing contract**

**2** These Regulations apply to every housing loan that is not insured under a contract of insurance that the Corporation and an approved lender entered into before the coming into force of these Regulations.




## Criteria



**Insurability**

**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (4) to (6), a housing loan must meet the criteria set out in section 4 and, as applicable, section 5 or 6 for the Corporation to be able to provide insurance against risks relating to it.

**Replacement of security and increased balance**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, if an insured housing loan is modified to both replace its security with a new eligible residential property and increase its outstanding balance, the increased portion is to be considered, for the purposes of these Regulations, as a new loan approved on the day on which the increase is approved, which must meet the criteria that apply on that day for the Corporation to be able to provide insurance against risks relating to it.

**Other modifications**

- **(3)** If any other modification is made to an insured housing loan that requires the payment of an additional housing loan insurance premium, the loan is to be considered, for the purposes of these Regulations, as a new loan approved on the day on which the modification is approved, which must meet the criteria that apply on that day for the Corporation to be able to provide insurance against risks relating to it. Any modification that does not require the payment of an additional housing loan insurance premium does not affect the Corporation’s ability to provide insurance.

**Loan workout**

- **(4)** The Corporation may provide insurance against risks relating to a housing loan that is made or modified in relation to a loan workout whose purpose is to reduce or avoid losses on a real or potential housing loan insurance claim on an outstanding insured housing loan if it meets the criteria set out in paragraph 4(a) and does not require the payment of an additional housing loan insurance premium.

**Loan discharge**

- **(5)** The Corporation may provide insurance against risks relating to a housing loan whose purpose is to discharge the outstanding balance of a prior insured housing loan if the new loan meets the criteria to which the prior loan was subject at the time of the discharge and does not require the payment of an additional housing loan insurance premium.

**Particular categories of loan**

- **(6)** The Corporation may provide insurance against risks relating to a housing loan if the loan is
	- **(a)** made to a borrower that is owned, otherwise guaranteed or subsidized by one of the following entities, and the purpose of the loan, guarantee or subsidy is to carry out a government social housing program:
		- **(i)** a provincial or municipal government,

		- **(iii)** an agency, agent corporation, mandatary corporation or housing corporation of a provincial or municipal government;
	- **(b)** in relation to a project that is owned, otherwise guaranteed or subsidized by an entity referred to in paragraph (a), and the purpose of the loan, guarantee or subsidy is to carry out a government social housing program;
