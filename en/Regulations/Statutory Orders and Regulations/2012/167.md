## Overview



**Purpose**

**1** 

- **(1)** These Regulations establish a regime for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions that result from the production of electricity by means of thermal energy using coal as a fuel, whether in conjunction with other fuels or not.

**Contents**

- **(2)** These Regulations are divided into four Parts as follows:
	- **(a)** Part 1 sets out a performance standard for the intensity of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from regulated units and provides for exceptions based on the substitution of units and for temporary exemptions in relation to emergencies and units integrated with carbon capture and storage systems;
	- **(b)** Part 2 sets out requirements for the reporting, sending, recording and retention of information;
	- **(c)** Part 3 sets out quantification rules for determining the intensity of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from regulated units; and
	- **(d)** Part 4 provides dates for the coming into force of these Regulations and, in particular, delays the coming into force of the performance standard in respect of standby units until January 1, 2030.

**Partial year application**

- **(6)** For greater certainty, if subsection (1) applies in respect of a unit only for a period during a calendar year, that period is considered to be the calendar year for the purpose of that subsection.




### Registration

## Quantification Rules



### Production of Electricity



**Electricity**

**19** 

- **(1)** The quantity of electricity referred to in paragraph 3(2)(a) is to be determined in accordance with the following formula:
```
G<sub>gross</sub> – G<sub>aux</sub>
```
where
- **G** <sub>gross</sub>is the gross quantity of electricity that is produced by the unit during the calendar year, expressed in GWh and measured at the electrical terminals of the generators of the unit using meters that comply with the requirements of the [Electricity and Gas Inspection Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-4.md) and the [Electricity and Gas Inspection Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/86/131.md); and
- **G** <sub>aux</sub>is the quantity of electricity that is used by the power plant in which the unit is located during the calendar year to operate infrastructure and equipment that is attributed to the unit for electricity generation and for separation, but not for pressurization, of CO<sub>2</sub>, expressed in GWh , determined in accordance with an appropriate method of attribution, based on data collected using meters that comply with the requirements of the [Electricity and Gas Inspection Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-4.md) and the [Electricity and Gas Inspection Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/86/131.md).

**Same method of attribution in subsequent years**

- **(2)** Once a method of attribution is used to make the determination referred to in the description of G<sub>aux</sub> for a calendar year, that method of attribution must be used to make that determination for every subsequent calendar year, unless
	- **(a)** during a subsequent calendar year, a unit located at the power plant ceases to produce electricity or a new unit is added to those located at the power plant; or
	- **(b)** during a subsequent calendar year, the operation of any unit located at the power plant is integrated with a carbon capture and storage system.

**Change of method of attribution**

- **(3)** If paragraph (2)(a) or (b) applies in a subsequent calendar year, the responsible person must, when making the determination referred to in the description of G<sub>aux</sub> in subsection (1) for that subsequent calendar year, use a method of attribution that is appropriate to the circumstances described in that paragraph. Subsection (2) applies in respect of that appropriate method of attribution and that subsequent calendar year as if they were, respectively, the method of attribution and the calendar year referred to in that subsection.




### CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions



#### Means of Quantification



**CEMS or fuel-based methods**

**20**
