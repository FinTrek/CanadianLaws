## Method of Allocation


**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the method for allocating the import access quantity for beef and veal that may be imported into Canada in each calendar year is as follows:
	- **(a)** applicants who are processors and retailer-processors shall receive a share of 75% of the import access quantity, in proportion to the quantity of beef and veal that do not originate in Chile or a NAFTA country processed at their own facilities during the 12-month period ending on October 31 in the calendar year before the calendar year for which the import allocation applies; and
	- **(b)** applicants who are distributors shall receive a share of 25% of the import access quantity, in proportion to their imports of beef and veal that do not originate in Chile or a NAFTA country during the 12-month period ending on October 31 in the calendar year before the calendar year for which the import allocation applies.

- **(1.1)** Despite subsection (1) and subject to subsection (2), the method for allocating the import access quantity for beef and veal that may be imported into Canada in the 2011 calendar year is as follows:
	- **(a)** applicants who are processors and retailer-processors shall receive a share of 75% of the import access quantity, in proportion to the quantity of beef and veal that did not originate in Chile or a NAFTA country and that was processed at their own facilities during either of the following base periods that an applicant identifies in an application for allocation, namely,
		- **(i)** the 16-month period ending on April 30, 2003 (prorated to a 12-month period), or
		- **(ii)** the 12-month period beginning on August 1, 2009 and ending on July 31, 2010; and
	- **(b)** applicants who are distributors shall receive a share of 25% of the import access quantity, in proportion to their imports of beef and veal that did not originate in Chile or a NAFTA country during the base period referred to in paragraph (a).

- **(2)** If an applicant under-utilizes their import allocation in any given calendar year, the import allocation for which they may be eligible for the next following calendar year is the import allocation in accordance with subsection (1) or (1.1), as the case may be, reduced by the percentage of their import allocation not utilized in that given calendar year.

- **(3)** Subsection (2) does not apply if
	- **(a)** the total amount of the applicant’s import allocation not utilized was less than 9 000 kg of beef and veal; or
	- **(b)** on or before October 31 in the calender year of the under-utilization, the applicant informs the Minister, in writing, that a specified portion of their import allocation of beef and veal will not be utilized in that calendar year.

- **(4)** The method of allocating the specified portions of non-utilized import allocations of beef and veal for a calendar year that are referred to in paragraph (3)(b) is, after October 31 in the calendar year, to grant an applicant the quantity of beef and veal that they apply for on a first come first served basis.
