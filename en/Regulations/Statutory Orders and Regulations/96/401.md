Enabling authorities: 
- [AERONAUTICS ACT](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md)

Date registered: 7 August 1996

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 5.5(1)<sup><a href='#fn_1'>[*]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), a copy of proposed Regulations respecting zoning at Trenton Airport, substantially in the form annexed hereto, was published in two successive issues of newspapers serving the area to which the proposed Regulations relate, namely on November 27 and 28, 1995 in the *Belleville Intelligencer*, on November 27 and 29, 1995 in the *Trentonian* and on December 12 and 19, 1995 in the *Brighton Independent,* and in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I, on July 2 and 9, 1994, and a reasonable opportunity was afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of National Defence with respect to the proposed Regulations;

And Whereas the proposed Regulations would prevent lands adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, Trenton Airport from being used or developed in a manner that is, in the opinion of the Minister of National Defence, incompatible with the safe operation of an airport or aircraft;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to paragraph 5.4(2)(b)<sup><a href='#fn_1'>[*]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), is pleased hereby to make the annexed Regulations respecting zoning at Trenton Airport.
