**6** 

- **(1)** In order to conserve mineral resources and to secure the orderly and regular development and the most efficient economic recovery thereof, the Minister may from time to time enter into an agreement with persons entitled to search for, win and take minerals for the consolidation, merger or combination of their interest, whether such purpose is accomplished by unit operations, cooperative development or joint participation.

- **(2)** For the purpose of implementing an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (1), the Minister may, with the consent of the lessee, amend any lease in any manner that the Minister deems necessary, except that the lease shall not be amended to provide for payment of a rental that is less than the minimum rental specified in subsection 5(1).
