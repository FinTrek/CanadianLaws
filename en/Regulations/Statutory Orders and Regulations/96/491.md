- **(3)** Where a project is in relation to a physical work, an environmental assessment shall be conducted in respect of every construction, operation, modification, decommissioning, abandonment or other undertaking in relation to that physical work that is proposed by the proponent or that is, in the opinion of
	- **(a)** the responsible authority, or
	- **(b)** where the project is referred to a mediator, a review panel or an advisory committee, the Minister, after consulting with the responsible authority and the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
likely to be carried out in relation to that physical work.


**16** 

- **(1)** Every screening of a project and every mediation or assessment by a review panel or an advisory committee shall include a consideration of the following factors:
