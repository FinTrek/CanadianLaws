## Determination of Earnings



### Earnings from Employment Other Than Employment as a Fisher


**4.1** If a period of employment for which insurable earnings have been reported on the record of employment falls partially within the fisher’s rate calculation period, the Commission shall, unless presented by the fisher or the employer with evidence of the amount of insurable earnings actually earned in the rate calculation period, allocate the amount of insurable earnings, not including any insurable earnings paid or payable by reason of lay-off or separation from employment, proportionately over that period of employment, on the basis that the fisher earned the same amount of insurable earnings for each of the seven days of each week.
> SOR/2013-32, s. 1.




**4.2** The insurable earnings paid or payable to a fisher, during the rate calculation period, by reason of lay-off or separation from employment is the lesser of
- **(a)** the actual amount of those earnings, and
- **(b)** the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:
```
A x 0.18%
```
where
- **A** is the fisher’s insurable earnings during the rate calculation period — not including those referred to in paragraph (a) — paid or payable for the employment that gave rise to the earnings referred to in that paragraph.
> SOR/2013-32, s. 1.





### Earnings from Employment as a Fisher


**5** 

- **(1)** The earnings of a fisher shall be determined as provided by this section.

- **(2)** The earnings of a fisher are the amount paid or payable to the fisher in respect of a catch, in accordance with the share arrangement, after deducting the value of any portion of the catch not caught by the crew of which the fisher is a member.

- **(3)** Where a fisher referred to in subsection (2) is a member of the crew and is the owner or lessee of the fishing vessel or fishing gear used by the crew in making the catch, or employs under a contract of service other persons who are engaged in making the catch, the earnings of the fisher are the amount remaining after deducting 25 per cent of the gross value of the catch and after deducting the wages and shares of the other members of the crew.

- **(4)** For the purpose of applying subsection (2), the value of any portion of the catch not caught by the crew shall be the amount established by the head fisher or, if the agent is the employer, by the agent for selling the catch of the crew.

- **(5)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the insurable earnings of a fisher are the earnings as determined in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) that are in respect of the qualifying period referred to in subsection 8(4) or (9), as the case may be.

- **(6)** For the purposes of subsection (5), the earnings of a fisher from a fishing trip that falls partly outside the qualifying period shall be allocated equally to each day of the trip and earnings for days of the fishing trip that precede the first Sunday of the qualifying period shall not be taken into account.




## Incomplete Records, Books of Account and Documents


**6** 

- **(1)** Where an officer of the Department of National Revenue determines that the records, books of account and documents of an employer of fishers are not, in respect of any of those fishers, sufficiently complete for the purpose of enabling the officer to determine the amount of insurable earnings of the fishers in respect of any period, the amount of the premiums payable and the dates on which they were paid or payable by that employer, the officer shall
	- **(a)** in respect of any fisher for whom the records, books of account and documents are adequate, determine the fisher’s insurable earnings and the premiums payable in accordance with the Act and the provisions of any regulations made under the Act, other than this section; and
	- **(b)** in respect of any fisher for whom the records, books of account and documents are inadequate, estimate the insurable earnings in the manner set out in subsection (2) and determine the premiums payable shall be five per cent of those estimated earnings.

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the officer shall, in respect of any fisher referred to in that paragraph, estimate
	- **(a)** the period during which any catches of that fisher were made;
	- **(b)** the number of fishers involved in any catch; and
	- **(c)** the earnings of the fisher for the period referred to in paragraph (a).

- **(3)** The aggregate earnings of all fishers for a period estimated in accordance with subsection (2) shall not exceed the gross returns from the sale of all the catches made by the fishers during the period.

- **(4)** The officer shall, in determining or estimating pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) the earnings in respect of which premiums are payable, exclude the deductions referred to in subsection 5(3) and any earnings that the officer is satisfied have been paid or are payable to a fisher who is not insured or in respect of whom the records, books of account and documents are adequate.

- **(5)** Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), the officer shall, on the first inspection of the records, books of account and documents of an employer, establish the earnings paid or payable in respect of any period to a fisher employed by the employer during the period, on the basis of oral or written information, and determine the insurable earnings and the premiums payable by the employer for the period by applying to the earnings so established the provisions of the Act and any regulations made under the Act, where the employer
	- **(a)** has not previously been sent a request to keep adequate records, books of account and documents;
	- **(b)** agrees to keep adequate records, books of account and documents;
	- **(c)** agrees to make immediate payment of any premiums that the officer, on the basis of any oral or written information, determines are owing; and
	- **(d)** has acted in good faith.




## Date of Payment of Remuneration


**7** For the purposes of section 82 of the Act, a fisher shall be considered to have been paid remuneration not later than
- **(a)** where, pursuant to subsection 3(3), the employer is the head fisher or the agent of the crew, the last day of the week in which the employer is paid the proceeds from the sale of the catch;
- **(b)** where the employer is a buyer who settles accounts with the fisher at intervals of more than seven days, the date on which the settlement is reached; and
- **(c)** where the employer is a person other than a person described in paragraph (a) or (b), the last day of the week in which the catch is delivered.
