## Non-Compliance with Requirement to Submit Evidence


**8** An election is considered not to have been made if any document or statutory declaration that is required by any of sections 5 to 7 is not submitted within one year after the day on which the election is made.




## Calculation of Joint and Survivor Benefit


**9** 

- **(1)** Subject to section 10, the amount of the monthly instalment of a joint and survivor benefit payable to the former member is equal to the amount obtained by subtracting from the former member’s monthly instalment of the allowances to which the former member is entitled under Parts I and II of the Act immediately before the election, an amount determined as follows:
	- **(a)** calculate the actuarial present value of the allowances to which the former member is entitled under Parts I and II of the Act immediately before the election, and the supplementary benefits payable in respect of those allowances under Part IV of the Act, taking into account the death benefit payable in accordance with section 61 of the Act;
	- **(b)** convert the amount determined in accordance with paragraph (a) into the following benefits, each of which has the same actuarial present value, namely,
		- **(i)** an immediate single life annuity that is payable to the former member by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part IV of the Act, as if the annuity were an allowance payable under Parts I and II of the Act, and
		- **(ii)** a benefit that consists of
			- **(A)** an immediate annuity that is payable, during the life of the former member, by monthly instalments beginning on the first day of the month after the month in which the election is made, and that is determined taking into account the percentage, namely 40, 50 or 60 per cent of the former member’s joint and survivor benefit, that the former member elects to allocate to the spouse and the supplementary benefits payable under Part IV of the Act, as if the immediate annuity were an allowance payable under Parts I and II of the Act, and
			- **(B)** a surviving spouse’s annuity that is payable, during the life of the former member’s surviving spouse, by monthly instalments beginning on the day after the day on which the former member died and that is equal to 40, 50 or 60 per cent, in accordance with the election made by the former member, of the immediate annuity determined in accordance with clause (A), and that is determined taking into account the supplementary benefits payable under Part IV of the Act, as if the surviving spouse’s annuity were an allowance payable under Parts I and II of the Act; and
	- **(c)** subject to subsection (2), subtract the amount of the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in clause (b)(ii)(A) from the first monthly instalment of the annuity referred to in subparagraph (b)(i) and adjust the amount to take into account
		- **(i)** that the joint and survivor benefit is payable to the former member during the least of
			- **(A)** the period of the life of the former member,
			- **(B)** the period of the life of the spouse, and
			- **(C)** the duration of the marriage, and
		- **(ii)** that the joint and survivor benefit begins to be payable in the month referred to in section 15.

- **(2)** For the purpose of paragraph (1)(c), where the calculation of the joint and survivor benefit is made for a former member in respect of whom a death benefit would be payable if the former member were to die on the day on which the election was made, the actuarial present value that is converted in accordance with subparagraph (1)(b)(i) shall not take into account the amount of that death benefit.




## Adjustments


**10** 

- **(1)** Where a former member has made an election and becomes entitled to and receives retiring or compensation allowances or supplementary benefits, as the case may be, by reason of being disabled, the amount of the former member’s joint and survivor benefit determined in accordance with section 9 shall be adjusted to take into account the new period during which the joint and survivor benefit or supplementary benefits are to be paid.

- **(2)** Where a former member in receipt of retiring or compensation allowances or supplementary benefits, as the case may be, by reason of being disabled ceases to be entitled to the retiring or compensation allowances or supplementary benefits, the amount of the former member’s joint and survivor benefit determined in accordance with section 9 shall be adjusted to take into account the new period during which the joint and survivor benefit or supplementary benefits, as the case may be, are to be paid.




## Actuarial Assumptions


**11** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of sections 9 and 10, the following are the only demographic assumptions on which the actuarial values are to be based:

	- **(b)** the rates of divorce are those established by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in accordance with statistics on divorce published by Statistics Canada.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), the valuation report is the most recent valuation report laid before Parliament or, where the most recent valuation report was laid less than two months before the day on which the former member made an election, the previously laid report.



**12** For the purposes of the determinations referred to in sections 9 and 10, the rates of interest set out in the Recommendations for the Computation of Transfer Values from Registered Pension Plans, published by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, effective September 1, 1993, shall be the rates of interest in respect of
- **(a)** subject to paragraph (b), fully indexed pensions; and
- **(b)** unindexed pensions for the period in respect of which no supplementary benefits would be payable under Part IV of the Act, in the case of a former member who has not yet reached 60 years of age.

	- **(b)** the amount of the joint and survivor benefit payable to the former member is adjusted in accordance with the [Pension Benefits Division Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1992/c.%2046,%20Sch.%20II.md) after the day on which the election was made.

- **(2)** Where it is established that a former member has received erroneous or misleading information as described in paragraph (1)(a), the Minister shall send the former member a written notice containing the correct information.

- **(3)** The revocation of the election under subsection (1) shall be in writing and shall be sent to the Minister

	- **(b)** the first day of the second month after the month in which the election is made.
