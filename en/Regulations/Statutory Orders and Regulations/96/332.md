**36** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the earnings of a claimant as determined under section 35 shall be allocated to weeks in the manner described in this section and, for the purposes referred to in subsection 35(2), shall be the earnings of the claimant for those weeks.

- **(2)** For the purposes of this section, the earnings of a claimant shall not be allocated to weeks during which they did not constitute earnings or were not taken into account as earnings under section 35.

- **(3)** Where the period for which earnings of a claimant are payable does not coincide with a week, the earnings shall be allocated to any week that is wholly or partly in the period in the proportion that the number of days worked in the week bears to the number of days worked in the period.

- **(4)** Earnings that are payable to a claimant under a contract of employment for the performance of services shall be allocated to the period in which the services were performed.

- **(5)** Earnings that are payable to a claimant under a contract of employment without the performance of services or payable by an employer to a claimant in consideration of the claimant returning to or beginning work shall be allocated to the period for which they are payable.

- **(6)** The earnings of a claimant who is self-employed, or the earnings of a claimant that are from participation in profits or commissions, that arise from the performance of services shall be allocated to the weeks in which those services are performed.

- **(6.1)** The earnings of a claimant who is self-employed, or the earnings of a claimant that are from participation in profits or commissions, that arise from a transaction shall be allocated
	- **(a)** if the aggregate amount of earnings that arise from a transaction occurring in a week is greater than the maximum yearly insurable earnings referred to in section 4 of the Act divided by 52, to the weeks in which the work that gave rise to the transaction was performed, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work that was performed during each of those weeks or, if no such work was performed, to the week in which the transaction occurred; or
	- **(b)** if the aggregate amount of earnings that arise from a transaction occurring in a week is less than or equal to the maximum yearly insurable earnings referred to in section 4 of the Act divided by 52, to the week in which the transaction occurred or, if the claimant demonstrates that the work that gave rise to the transaction occurred in more than one week, to the weeks in which the earnings were earned, in a manner that is proportional to the amount of work that was performed during each of those weeks.

- **(6.2)** The earnings of a claimant who is self-employed, or the earnings of a claimant that are from participation in profits or commissions, that do not arise from the performance of services or from a transaction shall be allocated equally to each week falling within the period in which the earnings were earned.

- **(7)** The earnings of a claimant who is self-employed in farming shall be allocated
	- **(a)** if they arose from a transaction, in accordance with subsection (6.1); and
	- **(b)** if they were received in the form of a subsidy, to the week in which the subsidy was paid.

- **(8)** Where vacation pay is paid or payable to a claimant for a reason other than a lay-off or separation from an employment, it shall be allocated as follows:
	- **(a)** where the vacation pay is paid or payable for a specific vacation period or periods, it shall be allocated
		- **(i)** to a number of weeks that begins with the first week and ends not later than the last week of the vacation period or periods, and
		- **(ii)** in such a manner that the total earnings of the claimant from that employment are, in each consecutive week, equal to the claimant’s normal weekly earnings from that employment; and
	- **(b)** in any other case, the vacation pay shall, when paid, be allocated
		- **(i)** to a number of weeks that begins with the first week for which it is payable, and
		- **(ii)** in such a manner that, for each week except the last, the amount allocated under this subsection is equal to the claimant’s normal weekly earnings from that employment.

- **(9)** Subject to subsections (10) to (11), all earnings paid or payable to a claimant by reason of a lay-off or separation from an employment shall, regardless of the period in respect of which the earnings are purported to be paid or payable, be allocated to a number of weeks that begins with the week of the lay-off or separation in such a manner that the total earnings of the claimant from that employment are, in each consecutive week except the last, equal to the claimant’s normal weekly earnings from that employment.

- **(10)** Subject to subsection (11), where earnings are paid or payable to a claimant by reason of a lay-off or separation from an employment subsequent to an allocation under subsection (9) in respect of that lay-off or separation, the subsequent earnings shall be added to the earnings that were allocated and, regardless of the period in respect of which the subsequent earnings are purported to be paid or payable, a revised allocation shall be made in accordance with subsection (9) on the basis of that total.

- **(10.1)** The allocation of the earnings paid or payable to a claimant by reason of a lay-off or separation from an employment made in accordance with subsection (9) does not apply if
	- **(a)** the claimant’s benefit period begins in the period beginning on January 25, 2009 and ending on May 29, 2010;
	- **(b)** the claimant contributed at least 30% of the maximum annual employee’s premium in at least seven of the 10 years before the beginning of the claimant’s benefit period;
	- **(c)** the Commission paid the claimant less than 36 weeks of regular benefits in the 260 weeks before the beginning of the claimant’s benefit period; and
	- **(d)** during the period in which the earnings paid or payable by reason of the claimant’s lay-off or separation from an employment are allocated in accordance with subsection (9) or, if the earnings are allocated to five weeks or less, during that period of allocation or within six weeks following the notification of the allocation, the claimant is referred by the Commission, or an authority that the Commission designates, under paragraph 25(1)(a) of the Act, to a course or program of instruction or training
		- **(i)** that is full-time,
		- **(ii)** that has a duration of at least 10 weeks or that costs at least $5,000 or 80% of the earnings paid or payable by reason of the claimant’s lay-off or separation from employment,
		- **(iii)** for which the claimant assumes the entire cost, and

		- **(i)** where the claimant made the earlier application, one week of those benefits plus half of the remaining weeks of benefits is payable to the claimant, and
		- **(ii)** where the provincial applicant made the earlier application, half the number of weeks of benefits remaining, after deducting one week, are payable to the claimant.

- **(3)** The maximum number of weeks of benefits that may be paid to the claimant under section 23 of the Act shall not be greater than the maximum number of weeks for which benefits may be paid under paragraph 12(3)(b) of the Act, less the number of weeks of provincial benefits that are paid to the provincial applicant, taking into account any weeks of provincial benefits that are paid at the accelerated rate referred to in subsection 76.19(2), if applicable.

- **(3)** If the provincial benefits may be paid at an accelerated rate, such that the maximum amount of a particular type of provincial benefit may be paid to a self-employed person over fewer weeks, and the self-employed person is paid those benefits at the accelerated rate, the number of weeks of benefits that those weeks of provincial benefits represent under the Act shall be determined by multiplying the number of weeks of the particular type of provincial benefits paid to the self-employed person by the result obtained by dividing the maximum number of such weeks of benefits payable at the non-accelerated rate by the maximum number of such weeks of benefits payable at the accelerated rate.

- **(4)** If the determination of the number of weeks under subsection (3) results in a number that contains a fraction of a week, the number shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of one week or, if the amount is equidistant from two multiples of one week, to the higher multiple.
> SOR/2010-301, s. 9.

	- **(a)** if the number of weeks of benefits that the self-employed person would otherwise be entitled to receive under section 152.05 of the Act is an even number, the number of weeks of benefits payable to the self-employed person is half that number; and
	- **(b)** if that number is an odd number,
		- **(i)** if the self-employed person made the earlier application, one week of those benefits plus half of the remaining weeks of benefits is payable to the self-employed person, and
