## Definitions



**Definitions**

**1** 

- **(1)** The following definitions apply in this Notice.

***Act*** means the [Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2018/c.%2012,%20s.%20186.md). (*Loi*)

***facility*** means
- **(a)** all of the following, that are operated in an integrated way to carry out the industrial activity, and are owned or operated by the same person or that have at least one owner or operator in common when there is more than one owner or operator:
	- **(i)** a site, or multiple sites, at which an industrial activity is carried out, and the buildings, equipment, and other structures and stationary items located on those sites, and
	- **(ii)** any other sites used in conjunction with the industrial activity, including a quarry, tailings pond, wastewater lagoon or pond and landfill; or
- **(b)** the portion of a natural gas transmission pipeline system within a province, used to transmit processed natural gas, of which the pipelines and associated installations or equipment – including compressor stations, storage installations and compressors – are owned or operated by the same person or have at least one owner or operator in common when there is more than one owner or operator, but excludes pipelines, installations or equipment that are used in the local distribution of natural gas, downstream of a metering station. (*installation*)

***foundry*** means a facility that produces metal ingots or uses a mould to produce a metal product of a specific shape or design the intended use of which when in that form is dependent in whole or in part on its shape or design. (*fonderie*)

***operator*** means a person who has the charge, management or control of a facility. (*exploitant*)

***petroleum refinery*** means a facility that is used to carry out the covered industrial activity referred to in paragraph 3(b) and for which the combined annual volume of gasoline, diesel fuel and lubricant basestock produced is greater than 40% of the annual volume of liquid petroleum products produced. (*raffinerie de pétrole*)

**Interpretation — Facility**

- **(2)** With respect to a facility
	- **(a)** any part of a public road or of a railway track that is bordered on both sides by the facility and used to carry out the facility’s industrial activities is deemed to be part of the facility;
	- **(b)** for greater certainty, any part of a railway track that is used exclusively to carry out the facility’s industrial activities is part of the facility;
	- **(c)** for greater certainty, buildings that are used for legal, administrative or management purposes and that are not located where an industrial activity is carried out are not included for the purposes of the definition of facility; and
	- **(d)** if two or more of the portions of a natural gas transmission pipeline system within a province, are owned or operated by the same person or have at least one owner in common but are not contiguous, each of those portions constitute a separate facility.
