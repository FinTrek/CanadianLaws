**PART 2** 
## Formula for Determining the Weighted Average Quantity of the Units in a Sample

For the purposes of paragraph 200(4)(a) of these Regulations, the formula for adjusting the sample mean to determine the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample is as follows:


```
X<sub>a</sub> = x + s(t ÷ √n)<sup><a href='#fn_SOR-2018-108_e_hq_22139'>[*]</a></sup>
```
where
- X<sub>a</sub>is the weighted average quantity of the units in the sample;
- xis the sample mean calculated as follows:
```
x = ∑x ÷ n
```
where
- **∑x** is the sum of the net quantities of all units in the sample;
- **s** is the standard deviation of the sample, calculated as follows:
```
s = √(∑(x – x)<sup>2</sup> ÷ (n – 1))
```
where
- **∑(x – ** x**)** <sup>2</sup>is the sum of the squared differences between the sample mean and the net quantity of each unit in the sample;
- **t** is the value determined in accordance with Part 3 for the selected sample size; and
- **n** is the number of units in the sample.

<a name='fn_SOR-2018-108_e_hq_22139'><sup>*</sup></a>: The value of (t ÷ √n) may, instead of being calculated in accordance with this Part, be determined using the applicable value set out in Column 3 of the table to Part 3.<br />
