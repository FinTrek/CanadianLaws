**Calculation**

**1** 

- **(1)** The percentage of moisture shrinkage for tough, damp, moist or wet grain that is artificially dried at the producer’s request at a licensed primary elevator is the percentage determined by the formula
```
(A – B) × 100/(100% – B)
```
where
- **A** is the grain’s percentage of moisture content before drying; and
- **B** is the grain’s percentage of moisture content after drying.

**Minimum percentage**

- **(2)** The percentage referred to in element B of the formula must be no less than 0.1% below the minimum percentage of moisture content specified for the tough grade of that grain in Schedule I or II of the [Off Grades of Grain and Grades of Screenings Order](/en/Regulations/Consolidated%20Regulations%20of%20Canada/801-900/C.R.C.,%20c.%20890.md).

**Weight of grain**

- **(3)** The grain’s moisture shrinkage must be calculated on the basis of the weight of the grain that is recorded by the elevator manager when it is delivered to the licensed primary elevator for artificial drying.




**Coming into Force**

**2** This Order comes into force on the day on which it is registered.
