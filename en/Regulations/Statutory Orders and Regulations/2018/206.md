----------

Whereas the World Trade Organization Agreement on Safeguards allows for the application of a safeguard measure to a good if it is determined that such good is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive goods;

Whereas the World Trade Organization Agreement on Safeguards further allows for the application of provisional safeguard measures for a 200-day period, in critical circumstances where delay would cause damages difficult to repair;

Whereas it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council, on the basis of a report of the Minister of Finance, that for each class described in the schedule to this Order, all of the steel goods, taken together, are being imported into Canada in increased quantities and have caused or threaten to cause serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive goods;

And whereas, on the basis of the report of the Minister of Finance, it does not appear to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council that the conditions set out in subsection 59(1) of the [Customs Tariff](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1997/c.%2036.md)<sup><a href='#nbp_81000-3-1686-E_hq_21552'>[a]</a></sup> have been met with respect to certain goods imported from Mexico and to goods imported from the United States, Chile, or Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to subsection 55(1) of the [Customs Tariff](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1997/c.%2036.md)<sup><a href='#nbp_81000-3-1686-E_hq_21552'>[a]</a></sup>, makes the annexed Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods.
