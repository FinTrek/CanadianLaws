Date registered: 11 October 2018

----------

Whereas the World Trade Organization Agreement on Safeguards allows for the application of a safeguard measure to a good if it is determined that such good is being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive goods;

Whereas the World Trade Organization Agreement on Safeguards further allows for the application of provisional safeguard measures for a 200-day period, in critical circumstances where delay would cause damages difficult to repair;

Whereas it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council, on the basis of a report of the Minister of Finance, that for each class described in the schedule to this Order, all of the steel goods, taken together, are being imported into Canada in increased quantities and have caused or threaten to cause serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive goods;

And whereas, on the basis of the report of the Minister of Finance, it does not appear to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council that the conditions set out in subsection 59(1) of the [Customs Tariff](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1997/c.%2036.md)<sup><a href='#nbp_81000-3-1686-E_hq_21552'>[a]</a></sup> have been met with respect to certain goods imported from Mexico and to goods imported from the United States, Chile, or Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to subsection 55(1) of the [Customs Tariff](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1997/c.%2036.md)<sup><a href='#nbp_81000-3-1686-E_hq_21552'>[a]</a></sup>, makes the annexed Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods.

<a name='nbp_81000-3-1686-E_hq_21552'><sup>a</sup></a>: S.C. 1997, c. 36<br />




**Origin of the goods**

**1** For the purposes of this Order, the origin of the goods is determined in accordance with the rules of origin set out in the [Determination of Country of Origin for the Purposes of Marking Goods (NAFTA Countries) Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/94/23.md) or the [Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (Non-NAFTA Countries) Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/94/16.md), as the case may be.




**Application**

**2** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (2) to (4), this Order applies to goods of a class that is set out in column 1 of the schedule, and that is described in column 2, that are imported from all countries.

**Exception**

- **(4)** This Order does not apply to goods being imported from a country benefiting from the General Preferential Tariff — and originating in that country — for which importation of the goods of the class in question did not, in 2017, exceed 3% of the total importation of goods of that class, provided that the importation of goods of that class from all countries benefiting from that Tariff did not, in 2017, exceed 9% of the total importation of goods of that class.




**Surtax**

**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (3) and (4), if all the goods of a class that is set out in column 1 of the schedule, and that is described in column 2, are imported in excess of the quantity referred to in column 3 for that class during one 50-day segment included in the period of 200 days beginning on the day on which this Order comes into force, those goods are subject to a surtax at the rate of 25% of their value for duty, the value for duty being determined in accordance with sections 47 to 55 of the [Customs Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(2nd%20Supp.).md).

**Clarification**

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), the quantity referred to in column 3 of the schedule applies to four consecutive 50-day segments — the first segment beginning on the day on which this Order comes into force — and any remaining portion of the quantity that is unused at the end of a segment is carried forward into the next segment.

**Permit**

- **(3)** For the purposes of subsection (1), the goods are considered to be imported in excess of the quantity referred to in column 3 of the schedule if they are not imported under a permit that is issued pursuant to the [Export and Import Permits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-19.md) in respect of item 82 of the [Import Control List](/en/Regulations/Consolidated%20Regulations%20of%20Canada/601-700/C.R.C.,%20c.%20604.md) and valid at the time at which the goods are accounted for under subsection 32(1), (3) or (5) of the [Customs Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(2nd%20Supp.).md).

**Quantity limit**

- **(4)** For the purposes of subsection (1), the goods are considered to be imported in excess of the quantity referred to in column 3 of the schedule if they originate in a country for which importation of the goods of the class in question exceed the percentage set out in column 5 of the quantity referred to in column 4.




**Coming into force**

For greater certainty, these dimensional restrictions apply to steel plate, which contains alloys greater than required by recognized industry standards provided that the steel does not meet recognized industry standards for an alloy-specification steel plate.
