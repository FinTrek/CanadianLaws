- **(g)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (f) to the other corners; and
- **(h)** if the removable floor pad is foldable, repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (f) to other locations on the removable floor pad that are most likely to be displaced upwards and that are situated along the edges of the removable floor pad that are parallel to the axis around which the floor pad folds.


**2** The following method is to be used for testing the vertical displacement of a removable and foldable component of a playpen that is composed of a rigid panel or a series of rigid panels and on which a removable floor pad rests:
- **(a)** assemble the playpen according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** remove the removable floor pad;
- **(c)** attach a clamp with a 19-mm diameter clamping surface as close as possible to a corner of the removable and foldable component;
- **(d)** using the clamp, apply a vertical upwards force of 2.2 N;
- **(e)** while maintaining the force, select a fixed reference point on the clamp that is near the upper surface of the removable and foldable component, and another fixed reference point on the component on which the floor pad rests, directly below the first fixed reference point;
- **(f)** using the clamp, gradually apply a vertical upwards force of 66 N over a period of five seconds;
- **(g)** while maintaining the force, measure the vertical upwards displacement of the removable and foldable component between the fixed reference points; and
- **(h)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) to (g) to the other corners and other locations on the removable and foldable component that are most likely to be displaced upwards and that are situated along the edges of the removable and foldable component that are parallel to the axis around which the component folds.

## Tests for Entrapment in Accessories
**1** The following method is to be used for testing openings that are created when an accessory is placed on or fixed to a playpen:
- **(a)** assemble the playpen and the accessory or accessories according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** place the accessory or combination of accessories on the playpen — or fix it or them to the playpen — in one of the manufacturer’s recommended use positions, and identify any openings that are created and are likely to permit the passage of the small head probe illustrated in Figure 1 to this section but not the large head probe illustrated in Figure 2 to this section;
- **(c)** rotate the small head probe to the orientation that is most likely to permit its passage through one of the identified openings and, from inside the occupant retention area of the playpen, gradually apply an upward or outward force of 111 N to the probe over a period of five seconds, then maintain the force for 10 seconds;
- **(d)** if the small head probe can pass entirely through the opening, repeat the step set out in paragraph (c) using the large head probe and attempt to pass it, without forcing it, through the opening in any orientation;
- **(e)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) for all the other identified openings; and
- **(f)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (e) for all the other manufacturer’s recommended use positions.
> Image: The small head probe simulates the head of a fifth percentile six-month-old child. The small head probe is an oval cylinder with a width of 144.8 mm, a depth of 109.2 mm and a height of 132.1 mm. The top surface is convex and has a radius of 54.6 mm. A handle protrudes from the bottom surface.

> Image: The large head probe simulates the head of a 97th percentile three-year-old child. The large head probe is shaped like a tapered cylinder. The height of the probe is 101.6 mm. The diameter of the probe is constant at 228.6 mm for the first 25.4 mm of height, measured from the bottom of the probe, and is then reduced to 203.2 mm over the next 76.2 mm of height. A handle protrudes from the centre of the bottom surface of the probe.



**2** The following method is to be used for testing openings that are created by the detachment or displacement of an accessory from a playpen:
- **(a)** assemble the playpen and the accessory or accessories according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** place the accessory or combination of accessories on the playpen — or fix it or them to the playpen — in one of the manufacturer’s recommended use positions, and identify the parts of the accessory that are most likely to detach or become displaced and so create an opening;
- **(c)** using a rod that has a circular tip with a diameter of 50 mm, gradually apply an upward or outward force of 111 N over a period of five seconds to one of the identified locations;
- **(d)** if an opening is created, attempt to pass the small head probe illustrated in Figure 1 to section 1, without forcing it, through the opening in any orientation;
- **(e)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) for all the other identified parts of the accessory; and
- **(f)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (e) for all the other manufacturer’s recommended use positions.

## Test for Angle of Foldable Mattress Pad of Sleep Accessories
**1** The following method is to be used for testing the angle of the surfaces adjacent to a fold in a foldable mattress pad that is supplied with, or that is designed or advertised to be used with, a sleep accessory:
- **(a)** assemble the playpen and sleep accessory according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** place the playpen on a horizontal surface in the manufacturer’s recommended use position;
- **(c)** place the sleep accessory on, or fix it to, the playpen in the manufacturer’s recommended use position;
- **(d)** if the playpen or sleep accessory rocks or swings, disable that function;
- **(e)** establish a horizontal reference plane by placing on the horizontal surface and near the playpen an inclinometer with a minimum resolution of 0.5° and set it out to zero;
- **(f)** place a cylinder that has a mass of 7.6 kg, a length of 305 mm and a diameter of 152 mm horizontally on a fold in the foldable mattress pad so that the centre of the cylinder is above the fold and the cylinder is aligned parallel to that fold, and if the cylinder does not remain in that location, place a sufficient number of stops to immobilize it, with the total mass of the stops not exceeding 0.11 kg;
- **(g)** place, within 12.7 mm of one of the ends of the cylinder, a steel block measuring 152 mm × 101.6 mm, that has a thickness of 12.7 mm and a mass of 1.5 kg so that one of the sides of the block is placed on the fold parallel to the central axis of the cylinder and ignore any contact that results from the block sliding and touching the cylinder;
- **(h)** if the size of the sleep accessory does not allow the steel block to be placed in accordance with paragraph (g), move the cylinder off-centre sufficiently so that the block can be placed in accordance with that paragraph;
- **(i)** if the size of the sleep accessory does not allow the steel block to be placed in accordance with paragraph (h), use a steel block with a mass of 1.5 kg that is of such a size that it can be placed in accordance with paragraph (g);
- **(j)** place the inclinometer on the centre of the upper surface of the block and measure the angle that is formed between the upper surface of the block and the horizontal, while ensuring that the inclinometer does not come into contact with the upper surface of the foldable mattress pad;
- **(k)** if the angle is greater than 7°, repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (g) to (j) two times and calculate the average of the three measurements;
- **(l)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (g) to (k) but move the block horizontally while maintaining the same orientation so that the opposite side of the block is placed on the same fold, parallel to the central axis of the cylinder;
- **(m)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (f) to (l) for all the other folds in the foldable mattress pad; and
- **(n)** remove any removable component of the sleep accessory that supports the foldable mattress pad and repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (f) to (m).
