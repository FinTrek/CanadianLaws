## Interpretation


**1** In these Regulations, ***casual goods*** means goods other than goods imported for sale or for an industrial, occupational, commercial or institutional or other like use.




## Casual Goods


**2** Subject to section 4, casual goods that are acquired in a CPTPP country are considered to originate in that country and are entitled to the benefit of the CPTPP tariff applicable to that country if
- **(a)** the marking of the goods is in accordance with the marking laws of that CPTPP country and indicates that the goods are either the product of that country or the product of Canada; or
- **(b)** the goods do not bear a mark and nothing indicates that the goods are neither the product of that CPTPP country nor the product of Canada.



**3** Subject to section 4, casual goods that are acquired in a CPTPP country — the marking of which is in accordance with the marking laws of that country and indicates that the goods are the product of a CPTPP country other than that country or Canada — are considered to originate in the CPTPP country indicated by that marking and are entitled to the benefit of the CPTPP tariff applicable to that CPTPP country.



**4** The CPTPP tariffs referred to in sections 2 and 3 are the CPTPP tariffs applicable to a CPTPP country set opposite the reference to that country in the column “Tariff Treatment / Other” in the List of Countries set out in the schedule to the [Customs Tariff](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1997/c.%2036.md).

<sup><a href='#fn_Ind84C9_hq_23531'>[*]</a></sup>**5** These Regulations come into force on the day on which section 43 of the [Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2018/c.%2023.md), chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada 2018, comes into force, but if they are registered after that day, they come into force on the day on which they are registered.
