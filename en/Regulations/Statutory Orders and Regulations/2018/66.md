**Applicable methods**

**23** 

- **(1)** For the purpose of sections 20 and 26, the volume of hydrocarbon gas produced, received, vented or destroyed at, or delivered from, an upstream oil and gas facility must be determined in accordance with the applicable method set out in
	- **(a)** the document entitled Measurement Guideline for Upstream Oil and Gas Operations, published by the Oil and Gas Commission of British Columbia on March 1, 2017, if the facility is located in British Columbia;
	- **(b)** the document entitled Measurement Requirements for Oil and Gas Operations and commonly referred to as Directive PNG017, published by the Government of Saskatchewan on August 1, 2017 (version 2.1), if the facility is located in Manitoba or Saskatchewan; and

			- **(A)** in accordance with section 24, or
			- **(B)** by the formula
```
−0.5P<sub>w</sub> + 150
```
where
- **P** <sub>w</sub>is the average volume, expressed in standard m<sup>3</sup>, of oil produced by the well for a day during the most recent month of production.




**Determination of gas-to-oil ratio**

**24** 

- **(1)** The determination of a gas-to-oil ratio for the purpose of clause 23(2)(b)(ii)(A) is made using the formula
```
G/O
```
where
- **G** is the average volume of gas produced by the well measured over a continuous period — of at least 72 hours or at least 24 hours, determined, as the case may be, in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) — under conditions, in particular in respect of flow rate and operating conditions, that are representative of the conditions that occurred during the most recent month of production; and
- **O** is the average volume of oil produced by the well over the period that is used for the determination of G, based on measurements taken in accordance with subsection (4) as prorated to that period and under conditions, in particular in respect of flow rate and operating conditions, that are representative of the conditions during the most recent month of production.

**Determination of value of G**

	- **(a)** over the continuous period used to determine the value of G with a continuous measuring device that has a maximum margin of error of ±0.1 standard m<sup>3</sup>; or
	- **(b)** over a continuous period of at least 10 days that includes the continuous period used to measure G with a continuous measuring device that has a maximum margin of error of ±1 standard m<sup>3</sup> and with the variation of flow rate in that continuous period such that the measured volume of oil produced for any day is within ±5% of the measured volume of oil produced for any other day in that continuous period.

**Steady state**

- **(5)** A measurement taken under any of subsections (2) to (4) must be taken while the well is operating in a steady state, that is, it must be taken only if no adjustment that could result in a change to the oil or gas production rates has been made to the production parameters for at least 48 hours before the measurement is taken.
