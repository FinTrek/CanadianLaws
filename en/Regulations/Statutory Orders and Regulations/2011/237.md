## Ballast Water Management



**Management processes**

**4** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of this section and section 5, ballast water is managed if one or more of the following management processes are employed:
	- **(a)** the ballast water is exchanged;
	- **(b)** the ballast water is treated;

**Ballast water from outside Canada**

- **(2)** Ballast water that is taken on board a vessel outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction must be managed in order to
	- **(a)** minimize both the introduction of harmful aquatic organisms or pathogens into the ballast water and their release with the ballast water into waters under Canadian jurisdiction; or
	- **(b)** remove or render harmless harmful aquatic organisms or pathogens within the ballast water.

**Exception — similar waters**

- **(3)** Ballast water that is taken on board a vessel in the United States waters of the Great Lakes Basin or in the French waters of the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon need not be managed unless it is mixed with other ballast water that was taken on board the vessel in any other area outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction and was not previously subjected to a management process set out in paragraph (1)(a) or (b).

**Exceptions — areas of exclusive operation**

- **(4)** A vessel need not manage ballast water if the vessel operates exclusively
	- **(a)** between ports, offshore terminals and anchorage areas on the west coast of North America north of Cape Blanco; or
	- **(b)** between ports, offshore terminals and anchorage areas on the east coast of North America north of Cape Cod and ports, offshore terminals and anchorage areas in the Bay of Fundy, on the east coast of Nova Scotia, or on the south or east coast of the island of Newfoundland.

**Exceptions — emergencies**

- **(5)** Ballast water need not be managed if one of the following emergency situations occurs:
	- **(a)** the uptake or release of ballast water is necessary for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the vessel in an emergency situation or saving life at sea;
	- **(b)** the uptake or release of ballast water is necessary for the purpose of avoiding or minimizing the discharge of a pollutant from the vessel; or
	- **(c)** the ingress or release of ballast water occurs as a result of an accident of navigation in which a vessel or its equipment is damaged, unless the accident occurs as a result of an action that is outside the ordinary practice of seafarers.
> SOR/2017-20, s. 3.





**Residual amounts**

**5** 

- **(1)** This section applies in respect of a vessel that is on a voyage to the Great Lakes Basin and carries only residual amounts of ballast water that was taken on board the vessel outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction — other than the United States waters of the Great Lakes Basin or the French waters of the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon — and that was not previously subjected to a management process set out in paragraph 4(1)(a) or (b).

**Exception**

- **(2)** The residual amounts of ballast water need not be managed if
	- **(a)** the requirements of sections 1, 2, 6 and 7 of the Code of Best Practices for Ballast Water Management, published by the Shipping Federation of Canada on September 28, 2000, are met while the vessel operates in waters under Canadian jurisdiction in the Great Lakes Basin; or
	- **(b)** a saltwater flushing of the ballast water tanks that contain the residual amounts of ballast water is conducted in an area at least 200 nautical miles from shore before the vessel enters waters under Canadian jurisdiction.

**Saltwater flushing**

- **(3)** For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), ***saltwater flushing*** means, in the following order,
	- **(a)** the addition of mid-ocean water to the ballast water tanks that contain the residual amounts of ballast water;
	- **(b)** the mixing, through the motion of the vessel, of the water added under paragraph (a) with the residual amounts of ballast water and any sediment that has settled out of them in the tanks; and
	- **(c)** the release of the waters mixed under paragraph (b) so that the salinity of the resulting residual ballast water in the tanks exceeds 30 parts per thousand or is as close as possible to 30 parts per thousand.

**Record**

- **(4)** If the exception set out in subsection (2) is taken advantage of in respect of a vessel, a record of compliance with paragraph (2)(a) or (b) must be carried on board the vessel for at least 24 months.

**Alternative measures**

- **(4)** After the Minister is notified, the master of the vessel must ensure that alternative measures are implemented that, without compromising the safety of the vessel or of persons on board the vessel, will reduce to the greatest extent feasible the likelihood of introducing harmful aquatic organisms or pathogens into waters under Canadian jurisdiction.

**Determining alternative measures**

- **(5)** In determining the alternative measures, the master of the vessel must, in consultation with the Minister, consider the following factors:

	- **(b)** any possible operations that would, taking into account prevailing sea conditions, remove or render harmless harmful aquatic organisms or pathogens into the ballast water taken on board the vessel outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction, or minimize their introduction in that ballast water or their release with that ballast water into waters under Canadian jurisdiction;
	- **(c)** the feasibility of implementing the possible operations, taking into account their compatibility with the design and operation of the vessel; and
	- **(d)** the consequences of the possible operations on the safety of the vessel and of persons on board the vessel.

**Minimum requirements**

- **(6)** The alternative measures must include one or more of the following:
	- **(a)** the retention of some or all of the ballast water on board the vessel while it is in waters under Canadian jurisdiction;
	- **(b)** the exchange of some or all of the ballast water;
