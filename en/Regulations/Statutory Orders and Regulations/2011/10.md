- **(1)** In this section, ***adjustable parameter*** means a device, system or element of design that is capable of being physically adjusted and can thereby affect emissions during emission testing or normal in-use operation, but does not include a device, system or element of design that is permanently sealed by the manufacturer or that is inaccessible with ordinary tools.

**Requirements**

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), an engine, vessel or vehicle that is equipped with adjustable parameters must conform to the applicable standards under these Regulations for any specification within the physically adjustable range.

**Vehicle**

	- **(a)** other than any air-fuel ratio that does not occur during normal in-use operation, is between the lean limit and the rich limit; or
	- **(b)** is established by the manufacturer based on particular engine parts.

**Lean limit**

- **(4)** The lean limit is the air-fuel ratio that produces the highest engine power output averaged over the applicable test cycle referred to in section 501 of subpart F of CFR 1051.

**Rich limit**

- **(5)** The rich limit is the richest of the following air-fuel ratios:
	- **(a)** the air-fuel ratio that results from operating the vehicle at applicable test conditions in accordance with the CFR, with the parameters adjusted to the settings that will be used at the time that the vehicle’s main assembly is completed, excluding a vehicle manufactured without jets installed in its carburetted engine;
	- **(b)** the air-fuel ratio of the engine during durability testing; and
	- **(c)** the richest air-fuel ratio specified by the manufacturer for the applicable ambient conditions.

**Carburettor jets and needles**

- **(6)** Despite subsection (3), if the range of adjustable air-fuel ratios of a vehicle is defined in terms of carburettor jets and needles, and the criteria in sections 115(d)(3)(ii) to (vi) of subpart B of CFR 1051 are met, the manufacturer’s jetting chart that specifies the appropriate carburettor jet size and needle configuration as a function of the ambient conditions is the range of adjustable air-fuel ratios for which compliance with the applicable standards under these Regulations is required.

**Fleet average emission credits or deficits**

**26** 

- **(1)** The fleet average emission credits or deficits, in respect of each emission type and for each fleet of engines, is the sum of the family emission credits or deficits for each emission family of that fleet determined in accordance with subsection (2).

- **Z** <sub>i</sub>is determined as follows:
- **(a)** for a fleet of snowmobiles,
- **(i)** in the case of exhaust emissions, the useful life for the emission family “i” expressed in kilometres — as established under section 103(c) of subpart B of CFR 1051 — multiplied by the maximum power output observed during the emissions test expressed in kilowatts divided by 30 km/h, and
