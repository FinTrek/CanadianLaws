- **(2)** For the purpose of subsection (1), if, at a particular time, an amount deemed to be held in trust by the person referred to in that subsection is not remitted to the Receiver General or withdrawn in the manner and at the time provided under Part IX of the Act, the amount of the prescribed security interest referred to in that subsection may not exceed the amount determined by the following formula until such time as all amounts deemed under subsection 222(1) of the Act to be held in trust by the person are withdrawn in accordance with subsection 222(2) of the Act or are remitted to the Receiver General:
