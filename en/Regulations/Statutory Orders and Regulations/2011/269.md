**Transfer of export allocation**

**4** When a primary producer or remanufacturer transfers, with the consent of the Minister under subsection 6.3(4) of the Act, a portion of the export allocation issued to it by the Minister for a month, that portion is deemed to be included in the volume of the primary producer’s or remanufacturer’s products that were exported in that month to the United States under export permits, and not in the volume of the transferee, if
- **(a)** the portion transferred includes a corresponding volume of products; or
- **(b)** the total of the portion that is transferred during the month and that does not include products does not exceed 15% of the volume of the primary producer’s or remanufacturer’s export allocation for the month.




## Ontario



**Determination of allocation**

**5** The allocation of the Ontario quantity to a primary producer or remanufacturer who applies for an export allocation is determined by the formula

```

**Allocation of remainder**

**6** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the allocation of the remainder of the Ontario quantity is based on the order of receipt of applications for an export permit for a share of the remainder, with each applicant receiving the volume applied for until the remainder of the Ontario quantity is fully allocated.

**Exhaustion of an allocation for a month**

- **(2)** An applicant who has received an allocation of the Ontario quantity for a month must exhaust that allocation before applying for an export permit for a share of the remainder, which is to be dealt with in accordance with subsection (1).
