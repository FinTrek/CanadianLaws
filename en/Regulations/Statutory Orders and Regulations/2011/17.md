### **SCHEDULE 3** 
**(Section 26 and paragraph 29(d))**
## Criteria for Determining if a Substance or Stuffing Material is Irritant, Corrosive or Sensitizing
**1** For the purposes of section 26 and paragraph 29(d) of these Regulations, a substance or stuffing material is irritant if human experience data or data obtained from testing performed in accordance with the test methods set out in this Schedule demonstrate that it is irritant to the eye or skin.



### Method for Testing Eye-Irritant Properties

**2** 

- **(1)** Use six albino rabbits for each test substance or stuffing material. Ensure that animal facilities for such procedures are designed and maintained so as to exclude sawdust, wood chips or other extraneous materials that might produce eye irritation. Examine both eyes of each rabbit before testing. Use only those rabbits without eye defects or irritation. Hold the rabbit firmly but gently until it is quiet. Place the test substance or stuffing material in one eye of each rabbit by gently pulling the lower lid away from the eyeball to form a cup into which the test substance or stuffing material is dropped. Gently hold the lids together for one second and then release the rabbit. The other eye, remaining untreated, serves as a control. For testing liquids, use 0.1 ml (2 drops) of the test substance or stuffing material. For testing solids or pastes, use 100 mg (1.5 grains) of the substance or stuffing material. For substances or stuffing materials in flake, granule, powder or other particulate form, use the amount that has a volume of 0.1 ml (2 drops) (after compacting as much as possible without crushing or altering the individual particles, such as by tapping the measuring container) whenever this volume weighs less than 100 mg (1.5 grains). In such a case, record the weight of the 0.1 ml (2 drops) test dose. Do not wash the eyes after instillation of the test substance or stuffing material except as noted in subsection (2).

- **(2)** Examine the eyes and record the grade of ocular reaction at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Use a binocular loupe, hand-held slit lamp or other expert means to facilitate observing the reactions. After the observations are recorded at 24 hours, the eyes may be further examined after fluorescein is applied. To do this, drop 0.05 ml (one drop) of fluorescein sodium ophthalmic solution U.S.P. or equivalent directly on the cornea. After the excess fluorescein is flushed out with sodium chloride solution U.S.P. or equivalent, injured areas of the cornea appear yellow. This is best visualized in a darkened room under ultraviolet illumination. The eyes may be washed with sodium chloride solution U.S.P. or equivalent after the 24-hour recording.

- **(3)** A rabbit is considered to exhibit a positive reaction if, at any of the observations, the test substance or stuffing material has produced one or more of the following reactions:
	- **(a)** an ulceration of the cornea, other than a fine stippling;
	- **(b)** an opacity of the cornea, other than a slight dulling of the normal lustre;
	- **(c)** an inflammation of the iris, other than a slight deepening of the folds (or rugae) or a slight circumcorneal injection of the blood vessels;
	- **(d)** an obvious swelling in the conjunctivae (excluding the cornea and iris) with partial eversion of the lids or a diffuse crimson-red with individual vessels that are not easily discernible.

- **(4)** The test is positive if four or more of the rabbits in the test group exhibit a positive reaction. If only one rabbit exhibits a positive reaction, the test is considered negative. If two or three rabbits exhibit a positive reaction, repeat the test using a different group of six rabbits. The second test is positive if three or more of the rabbits exhibit a positive reaction. If only one or two rabbits in the second test group exhibit a positive reaction, repeat the test with a different group of six rabbits. If a third test is needed, the substance or stuffing material is irritant if any rabbit exhibits a positive reaction.



### Method for Testing Skin-Irritant Properties

**3** 

- **(1)** Measure primary irritation to the skin by means of a patch-test technique on the abraded and intact skin of an albino rabbit clipped free of hair. Use a minimum of six rabbits. Introduce the test substance or stuffing material — 0.5 ml (10 drops) in the case of liquids or 0.5 g (7-8 grains) in the case of solids or semisolids — under a square patch that is made up of two layers of surgical gauze measuring 25 mm by 25 mm (1 inch by 1 inch). Dissolve solids in an appropriate solvent and apply the solution as in the case for liquids. Immobilize the rabbits and secure the patches in place with adhesive tape. Wrap the entire trunk of the rabbit with an impervious material such as rubberized cloth for the 24-hour period of exposure. This material aids in maintaining the test patches in position and retards the evaporation of volatile substances or stuffing materials.

- **(2)** After 24 hours of exposure, remove the patches and evaluate the reactions on the basis of the designated values in the following table:
<table>

<a name='footnote1_e'><sup>1</sup></a>: The value recorded at each observation is the average value for the six or more rabbits subjected to the test.<br />

- **(3)** Repeat the observations at the end of a total of 72 hours (48 hours after the first observation). Make an equal number of exposures on areas of skin that have been previously abraded. Ensure that the abrasions are minor incisions through the *stratum corneum* (horny layer of the epidermis), but not sufficiently deep so as to disturb the derma or to produce bleeding. Evaluate the reactions of the abraded skin at 24 hours and 72 hours, as set out in subsection (2). Add the values for erythema and eschar formation at 24 hours and at 72 hours for intact skin to the values for abraded skin at 24 hours and at 72 hours (four values). Similarly, add the values for edema formation at 24 hours and at 72 hours for intact and abraded skin (four values). Divide the total of the eight values by four to obtain the primary irritation score. A score of five or more indicates that the substance or stuffing material is irritant.


**4** For the purposes of section 26 of these Regulations, a substance is corrosive if it causes visible destruction or irreversible damage in tissue at the site of the application.


**5** For the purposes of section 26 of these Regulations, a substance is sensitizing if human experience data demonstrate that it causes an allergenic sensitization in a substantial number of humans who come into contact with it.

### **SCHEDULE 5** 
**(sections 32 and 33)**
## Test Method for Dolls, Plush Toys and Soft Toys That Are Covered with a Flat or Raised Fibre Textile Material or Natural Fur
Remove the covering from the doll, plush toy or soft toy and test it in accordance with the following method:



### Scope

**1** This method covers the evaluation of the flammability of outer coverings of dolls, soft toys, plush toys, and any other product for use by a child in play, that are covered with a flat or raised fibre textile material or natural fur, including dolls’ clothing. In this Schedule, the term “raised fibre surface” means a napped, pile, tufted, flocked or similar surface.



### Procedure

**2** Cut specimens from the outer covering and prepare them by brushing the raised fibre surface, by laundering if they have a flame-retarding finish, and by drying. Hold each dried specimen at a 45° angle in the specimen holder of the flammability tester. Apply a standardized flame to the surface of the specimen near the lower end for one second. Record the time that is required for flaming to proceed up the specimen over a distance of 127 mm (5 inches).



### Required Materials

**3** 

- **(1)** Flammability tester described in section 1 of Schedule 6.

- **(2)** Brushing device described in section 2 of Schedule 6.

- **(3)** Laboratory drying oven.

- **(4)** Desiccator that is 250 mm (9.8 inches) in diameter.

- **(5)** Calcium chloride, anhydrous.

- **(6)** Butane, cp.

- **(7)** A commercially available detergent.

- **(8)** Mercerized cotton sewing thread No. 50.



### Test Specimens

**4** 

- **(1)** Select five test specimens, each measuring 51 mm by 152 mm (2 inches by 6 inches) from the part of the outer covering that burns most rapidly.

- **(2)** When possible, in order to select the specimens that burn most rapidly, determine the direction in which to cut the specimens and the part of the outer covering from which to select the specimens. Do this by making preliminary trials, in accordance with the 45° angle test, with specimens cut in different directions and from different locations on the outer covering. Cut the test specimens in the chosen direction and from the chosen location on the outer covering. For textiles that have a raised fibre surface, the long dimension usually is in the direction of the lay of the surface fibres.

- **(3)** Pieces may be removed and reassembled in the specimen holder in the same manner as in the original assembly, to the extent that the pieces are of such a size that they can be securely held in place by the specimen holder, if the outer covering is an assembly and a portion of the outer covering, including any seams, cannot be removed from the assembly in a size large enough to provide the required specimen.

- **(4)** If the outer covering is known to have a flame-retarding finish or if preliminary testing indicates that such a finish may be present, ensure that it is laundered in accordance with section 5.



### Laundering Procedure

**5** 

- **(1)** Precondition outer covering samples that are known to have or that are suspected of having a flame-retarding finish applied to them by subjecting them to the washing and drying procedure described in this section.

- **(2)** Prepare a bath solution that consists of water that has a hardness of not greater than 324 mg (5 grains) of calcium carbonate per 4.5 L (1.0 imperial gallons) in an amount 30 times the weight of the sample from which the specimens are to be taken and a commercially available detergent in an amount equal to 15% of this weight. Ensure that the temperature of the bath solution is from 35°C to 38°C inclusive (95°F to 100°F).

- **(3)** Immerse the sample and allow it to soak for 3 minutes. Work it gently by hand for 2 minutes, squeezing the bath solution through the part of the sample to be tested.

- **(4)** Rinse the sample three times in water that has a hardness of not greater than 324 mg (5 grains) of calcium carbonate per 4.5 L (1.0 imperial gallons) in an amount 30 times the weight of the sample. Ensure that the temperature of the rinse water is 27°C (80°F). Immerse and gently squeeze the sample in the first rinsing bath for 1 minute and in the second and third baths for 2 minutes each.

- **(5)** Remove excess water from the sample after each bath by squeezing gently. After the final rinsing bath blot out as much moisture as possible using paper towels or cotton terrycloth.

- **(6)** Lay the sample flat to dry at ambient temperature, namely, from 18°C to 24°C inclusive (65°F to 75°F).



### Preparation of Specimens

**6** 

- **(1)** Mark out five specimens, each 51 mm by 152 mm (2 inches by 6 inches), on the reverse side of the sample. Mark the longer dimension in the direction in which burning is most rapid, as established in the preliminary trials referred to in subsection 4(2). Identify the end of each specimen toward which flame spread is most rapid by attaching a staple to it. Cut the specimens from the outer covering.

- **(2)** Brush each specimen that has a raised fibre surface once against the lay of the surface fibres with the brushing device illustrated in Figure 2 of Schedule 6. Specimens that do not have a raised fibre surface do not require brushing.

- **(3)** Clamp each specimen individually in the specimen holders of the flammability tester illustrated in Figure 1 of Schedule 6. The stapled end is to be in the upper position during the test to ensure that the specimen is mounted in the direction in which burning is most rapid. Dry the mounted specimen in a horizontal position in an oven for 30 minutes at 105°C (221°F) or for 120 minutes at 75°C (167°F). Remove it from the oven and place it until cool in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride for at least 15 minutes and not more than 2 hours.



### Procedure

**7** 

- **(1)** Adjust the position of the rack of the flammability tester with a holder and trial specimen (not a prepared specimen) so that the tip of the indicator touches the surface of the specimen.

- **(2)** Open the control valve of the fuel supply and allow approximately 5 minutes for the air to be driven from the fuel line. Ignite the gas and, with the door closed as far as possible, adjust the flame to a length of 16 mm (5/8 inch) measured from its tip to the opening in the gas nozzle.

- **(3)** Remove a mounted specimen from the desiccator and place it in position on the rack in the chamber of the flammability tester. Ensure that the flame impinges on the test specimen within 45 seconds after the time it is removed from the desiccator. String the stop cord (mercerized cotton sewing thread No. 50) through the guides in the upper plate of the specimen holder, across the top of the specimen, through the guides at the rear of the chamber and through the guide ring. Attach the weight to the cord close to and just below the guide ring.

- **(4)** Close the door of the flammability tester. Set the stop watch to zero. Conduct the test in a draft-free room with the flammability tester at room temperature.

- **(5)** Bring the starting lever over to the extreme right and release it. This starts the timing mechanism and applies the flame to the specimen for a period of one second. Timing is automatic, starting on the application of the flame and ending when the weight is released by the burning of the stop cord.

- **(6)** Record the flame spread time for each specimen.



### Interpretation of Results

**8** 

- **(1)** A specimen that exhibits either base burning or surface burning of sufficient intensity to sever the stop cord in 7 seconds or less is considered to have failed the test.

- **(2)** Test five additional specimens if one of the five specimens fail. If two out of 10 specimens fail, the doll, plush toy or soft toy does not meet the test requirement.





### **SCHEDULE 6** 
**(subsection 32(3), section 34 and Schedules 5 and 7)**
## Description of Apparatus

### Flammability Tester

**1** 

- **(1)** The flammability tester illustrated in Figure 1 consists of a draft-proof ventilated metal combustion chamber that encloses a standardized ignition medium, a specimen rack and an automatic timing device.

- **(2)** The combustion chamber prevents air circulation around the specimen rack and flame, but permits free ventilation for rapid combustion. The chamber is 368 mm (14½ inches) wide by 216 mm (8½ inches) deep by 356 mm (14 inches) high. There are 12 holes that measure 12.7 mm (½ inch) equidistant along the rear of the top closure. A ventilating strip is provided at the base of the sliding glass door in the front of the chamber.

- **(3)** The specimen rack provides support for the frames in which the specimens are mounted. The angle of inclination of the specimen rack is 45°. Two guide pins that project downward from the centre of the base of the rack are positioned into slots that are located in the floor of the combustion chamber. This allows for the adjustment of the specimen in relation to its thickness and the flame front. The specimen rack has an indicating finger with a fore part that touches the specimen when the rack is correctly adjusted.

- **(4)** The specimen holder consists of two 1.6 mm (1/16 inch) matched metal plates with clamps mounted along the sides of the plates. The specimen is fixed between the plates. The plates are slotted and loosely pinned for alignment. The two plates of the specimen holder cover the full length of the specimen but do not cover 38.1 mm (1½ inches) of its width. The specimen holder is supported in the combustion chamber on the rack at a 45° angle. Five specimen holders are provided.

- **(5)** Two control knobs hold the rack in test position. The knobs can be reached under the stage of the cabinet and permit, when loosened, forward and backward movements of the rack.

- **(6)** The ignition medium consists of a spring-motor driven gas jet formed around a 26-gauge hypodermic needle. A trigger located in the front of the flammability tester serves to wind the spring-motor when the flammability tester is ready for operation. The gas jet is protected by a copper shield.

- **(7)** The stop cord is stretched from the spool through suitable thread guides provided on the specimen holder and chamber walls. This allows the cord to be laced in the proper position, exactly 127 mm (5 inches) from the point where the centre of the ignition flame impinges on the test specimen. Use a mercerized sewing thread No. 50 for the stop cord.

- **(8)** A weight that is attached by means of a clip to the stop cord actuates the stop motion when it is dropped.

- **(9)** The glass door slides in grooves at the front of the cabinet. A knob moves the catch mechanism used to hold the sliding door in an open position for insertion of the test specimen holders.

- **(10)** A sensitive fuel control valve regulates the fuel supply at the tank. The valve ends in a ½-inch male connection for attachment to a standard No. 4 butane cylinder of 0.91 kg (2 pounds) capacity.

- **(11)** The flow meter consists of a U-shaped glass tube that is installed into the gas line to register the gas pressure delivered to the microburner. A movable metal plate with two parallel horizontal lines properly spaced to indicate the desired gas pressure is attached to the case wall behind the flow metre. When the pressure is off, the plate is regulated so that the liquid level in both sides of the U-shaped tube meets the lower line. When the flammability tester is in operation, the pressure is adjusted so that the higher liquid level in the U-shaped tube meets the upper line.

- **(12)** The starting lever is operated from left to right in one stroke and is released to operate the gas jet. A driving mechanism on the rear of the cabinet moves the gas jet to its most forward position. The mechanism automatically starts the stop watch by means of special attachments at the moment of flame impact. When the cord is cut, the weight drops on a platform and stops the watch. Timing is read directly.



### Brushing Device

**2** 

- **(1)** The brushing device illustrated in Figure 2 consists of a baseboard over which a small carriage is drawn on parallel tracks that are attached to the edges of the upper surface of the baseboard. The brush is hinged with pin hinges at the rear edge of the baseboard and rests vertically on the carriage with a pressure of 150 g (1/3 pound).

- **(2)** The brush consists of two rows of stiff nylon bristles mounted with the tufts in a staggered position. The bristles are 0.41 mm (0.016 inch) in diameter and 19 mm (0.75 inch) in length. There are 20 bristles per tuft and four tufts per 25 mm (1 inch). A clamp is attached to the forward edge of the carriage to permit the specimen to be held on the carriage during the brushing operation.

- **(3)** After the specimen has been put in place on the carriage and fastened by means of the clamp, raise the brush, push the carriage to the rear and lower the brush to the surface of the specimen. Then draw the carriage forward by hand at a constant speed.



### Modified Specimen Holder

**3** The modified specimen holder consists of the holder described in subsection 1(4) with the addition of 38-gauge (B & S) spring steel wire securely attached across its width at 1.27 cm (½ inch) intervals. This arrangement allows the calibrated flame to impinge at a point midway between the two lowest wires.

### **SCHEDULE 7** 
**(paragraph 32(3)(a), subsection 33(1) and paragraph 34(a))**
## Test Method for Dolls, Plush Toys and Soft Toys That Are Made of or Covered with Spun Staple Yarn or Bulked Continuous Filament Yarn

### Scope

**1** This method covers the evaluation of the flammability of dolls, plush toys and soft toys that have at least one of the following characteristics:
- **(a)** they have exposed surfaces that consist of spun staple yarn or bulked continuous filament yarn; or
- **(b)** they are constructed, in whole or in part, of parallel bundles of spun staple yarn or bulked continuous filament yarn that are exposed.



### Procedure

**2** Prepare specimens that are cut from a doll, plush toy or soft toy by laundering (if they have a flame-retarding finish) and by drying. Hold the dried specimen at a 45° angle in the specimen holder of the flammability tester. Apply a standardized flame to the lower end for one second, and record the time that is required for flaming to proceed up the specimen over a distance of 127 mm (5 inches).



### Required Materials

**3** 

- **(1)** Flammability tester described in section 1 of Schedule 6.

- **(2)** Brushing device described in section 2 of Schedule 6.

- **(3)** Modified specimen holder described in section 3 of Schedule 6.

- **(4)** Laboratory drying oven.

- **(5)** Desiccator that is 250 mm (9.8 inches) in diameter.

- **(6)** Calcium chloride, anhydrous.

- **(7)** Butane, cp.

- **(8)** Commercially available detergent.

- **(9)** Mercerized cotton sewing thread No. 50.



### Test Specimens

**4** 

- **(1)** Ensure that the yarn is laundered in accordance with section 5 if it is known to have a flame-retarding finish or if preliminary testing indicates that such a finish may be present.

- **(2)** Select from the part of the outer covering that burns most rapidly specimens of the yarn that each measure 152 mm (6 inches) in length.



### Laundering Procedure

**5** 

- **(1)** Precondition outer covering samples that are known to have, or that are suspected of having, a flame-retarding finish applied to them by subjecting them to the washing and drying procedure described in this section.

- **(2)** Prepare a bath solution that consists of water that has a hardness of not greater than 324 mg (5 grains) of calcium carbonate per 4.5 L (1.0 imperial gallons) in an amount 30 times the weight of the sample and a commercially available detergent in an amount equal to 15% of this weight. Ensure that the temperature of the bath solution is from 35°C to 38°C inclusive (95°F to 100°F).

- **(3)** Immerse the sample and allow it to soak for 3 minutes. Work the sample gently by hand for 2 minutes, squeezing the bath solution through the part of the sample to be tested.

- **(4)** Rinse the sample three times in water that has a hardness not greater than 324 mg (5 grains) of calcium carbonate per 4.5 L (1.0 imperial gallons) in an amount 30 times the weight of the sample. Ensure that the temperature of the rinse water is 27°C (80°F). Immerse and gently squeeze the sample in the first rinsing bath for 1 minute and in the second and third baths for 2 minutes each.

- **(5)** Remove excess water from the sample after each bath by squeezing gently. After the final rinsing bath blot out as much moisture as possible using paper towels or cotton terrycloth.

- **(6)** Lay the sample flat to dry at ambient temperature, namely, from 18°C to 24°C inclusive (65°F to 75°F).



### Preparation of Specimens

**6** Place specimens side by side, without overlapping, and clamp sufficient 152 mm (6 inch) lengths of the yarn in the modified specimen holder to form a 25 mm (1 inch) wide specimen in the centre of the holder. The loose ends may be tucked under the bottom wire to hold them in place. Prepare five test specimens. Dry the mounted test specimens in an oven for 30 minutes at 105°C (221°F) or for 120 minutes at 75°C (167°F). Remove them from the oven and place them until cool in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride for at least 15 minutes and not more than 2 hours.



### Procedure

**7** 

- **(1)** Open the control valve of the fuel supply and allow approximately 5 minutes for the air to be driven from the fuel line. Ignite the gas and, with the door closed as far as possible, adjust the flame to a length of 16 mm (5/8 inch) measured from its tip to the opening in the gas nozzle.

- **(2)** Remove a specimen from the desiccator and trim the lower ends to the length that will ensure that the ignition flame will contact the end of the yarn.

- **(3)** Test the specimen within 45 seconds after the time it is removed from the desiccator. String the stop cord (mercerized cotton sewing thread No. 50) through the guides in the upper plate of the specimen holder, across the top of the specimen, through the guides at the rear of the chamber and through the guide ring. Attach the weight to the cord close to and just below the guide ring.

- **(4)** Close the door of the flammability tester. Set the stop watch to zero. Conduct the test in a draft-free room with the flammability tester at room temperature.

- **(5)** Bring the starting lever over to the extreme right and release it. This starts the timing mechanism and applies the flame to the specimen for a period of one second. Timing is automatic, starting on application of the flame and ending when the weight is released by the burning of the stop cord.

- **(6)** Record the flame spread time for each specimen.



### Interpretation of Results

**8** 

- **(1)** A specimen that exhibits burning of sufficient intensity to sever the stop cord in 7 seconds or less is considered to have failed the test.

- **(2)** Test five additional specimens if one of the five fails. If two out of 10 specimens fail, the doll, plush toy or soft toy does not meet the test requirements.

### **SCHEDULE 9** 
**(Section 43)**
## Test Method for Integrity of Magnetic Toys and Magnetic Components
**1** The following method is to be used for testing the integrity of magnetic toys and magnetic components:
- **(a)** in the case of a magnetic toy or magnetic component that is made of wood, that is intended to be used in water or that is brought into contact with the user’s mouth in order to be used, begin by completing the following steps:
	- **(i)** submerge it for four minutes in a container of demineralized water that is maintained at a temperature of 21 ± 5°C,
	- **(ii)** remove it from the water and shake off the excess water,
	- **(iii)** maintain it at a temperature of 21 ± 5°C for 10 minutes,
	- **(iv)** repeat steps (i) to (iii) three more times and proceed immediately to the next step;
- **(b)** subject to paragraph (c), place the magnetic toy or the magnetic component being tested near another magnetic component of that same toy or component using the orientation that creates the strongest magnetic attraction in the course of reasonably foreseeable use of the toy or component and allow them to connect then pull them apart to the distance where magnetic attraction ceases;
- **(c)** if the magnetic toy or the magnetic component cannot be tested without either of them breaking or if the toy or the magnetic component has only one magnet, place the magnetic toy or the magnetic component near a flat, circular reference disc with a minimum nickel content of 99%, a diameter of 30 mm and thickness of 10 mm using the orientation that creates the strongest magnetic attraction in the course of reasonably foreseeable use of the toy or component and allow them to connect then pull them apart to the distance where magnetic attraction ceases;
- **(d)** repeat the step described in paragraph (b) nine more times;
- **(e)** test the magnetic toy or the magnetic component according to the tests set out in the following sections of the ASTM international standard F963, entitled Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety, as amended from time to time, in the order below, while ensuring that for toys for use by a child of at least 8 years of age, the criteria for children over 36 months in Table 5 entitled “Test Parameters for Use and Abuse Tests” and the weight criteria in section 8.7.1 of that standard are used:
	- **(i)** section 8.7.1 “Drop Test”,
	- **(ii)** section 8.7.2 “Tipover Test for Large, Bulky Toys”, as these toys are defined in that Standard and in which section “worst attitude” is replaced by “most onerous position”,
	- **(iii)** section 8.8 “Torque Tests for Removal of Components”,
	- **(iv)** section 8.9 “Tension Test for Removal of Components”,
	- **(v)** section 8.25.4.6 “Impact Test”,
	- **(vi)** section 8.25.4.7 “Compression Test”;
- **(f)** repeat step (b) 10 more times.

### **SCHEDULE 10** 
**(Section 43)**
## Test Method for Determination of Magnetic Flux Index

### Required Materials

**1** The following materials are required for determining the magnetic flux index:
- **(a)** a direct current field Gauss meter with a resolution of 0.0005 T that is capable of determining the flux density of the magnetic field to a minimum accuracy of 1.5% and that has an axial type probe with an active area diameter of 0.76 ± 0.13 mm that is at a distance of 0.38 ± 0.13 mm from the probe tip; and
- **(b)** a caliper or similar device for measuring dimensions to a minimum accuracy of 0.1 mm.



### Procedure

**2** The following method is to be used for determining the magnetic flux index:
- **(a)** place the Gauss meter probe tip perpendicularly against the surface of the magnetic toy or the magnetic component and slowly move the probe across the entire surface to locate the maximum absolute value of the flux density;
- **(b)** record the maximum absolute value of the flux density in tesla;
- **(c)** extract the magnet by breaking the magnetic toy or magnetic component, if necessary, without damaging the magnet;
- **(d)** calculate in square millimetres the area of the biggest pole surface of the magnet using the geometric formula for the surface area that corresponds to the shape of the surface:
	- **(i)** if the pole surface is flat, measure the dimensions with an accuracy of ± 0.1 mm,
	- **(ii)** if the pole surface is not flat, as in (i), measure the dimensions of the maximal cross-section that is perpendicular to the axis that goes through the magnet poles with an accuracy of ± 0.1 mm,
	- **(iii)** if the magnet is a multi-pole magnet, measure the dimensions of the largest single pole, which can be identified using magnetic field viewing film or an equivalent method;
- **(e)** square the maximum absolute value of the flux density and multiply it by the area of the biggest pole surface of the magnet to obtain the magnetic flux index, expressed in tesla squared millimetre squared.
