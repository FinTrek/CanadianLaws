----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 332(1)<sup><a href='#fn_SOR-2009-264_e_hq_7994'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md)<sup><a href='#fn_SOR-2009-264_e_hq_7995'>[b]</a></sup>, the Minister of the Environment published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on April 26, 2008, a copy of the proposed Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings Regulations, substantially in the annexed form, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the proposed Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection;

<a name='fn_SOR-2009-264_e_hq_7994'><sup>a</sup></a>: S.C. 2004, c. 15, c. 31<br />

<a name='fn_SOR-2009-264_e_hq_7995'><sup>b</sup></a>: S.C. 1999, c. 33<br />

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 93(3) of that Act, the National Advisory Committee has been given an opportunity to provide its advice under section 6<sup><a href='#fn_SOR-2009-264_e_hq_7996'>[c]</a></sup> of that Act;

## Determination of VOC Concentration



**General formula**

**12** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the VOC concentration of an architectural coating set out in the schedule, diluted to the maximum recommendation of the manufacturer, importer or seller, excluding the volume of any water and excluded compounds, must be determined using the following equation:
```
VOC concentration = (Ws - Ww - Wec) ÷ (Vm - Ww - Vec)
```
where
- **VOC concentration** is the VOC concentration of an architectural coating, in grams of VOC per litre of coating;
- **Ws** is the weight of volatiles, in grams;
- **Ww** is the weight of water, in grams;
- **Wec** is the weight of excluded compounds, in grams;
- **Vm** is the volume of architectural coating, in litres;
- **Vw** is the volume of water, in litres; and
- **Vec** is the volume of excluded compounds, in litres.

**Low solids coating**

- **(2)** The VOC concentration of a low solids coating set out in the schedule, diluted to the maximum recommendation of the manufacturer, importer or seller, including the volume of any water and excluded compounds, must be determined using the following equation:
```
VOC<sub>ls</sub> concentration = (Ws - Ww - Wec) ÷ (Vm)
```
where
- **VOC** <sub>ls</sub>** concentration** is the VOC concentration of a low solids (ls) coating, in grams of VOC per litre of coating,
- **Ws** is the weight of volatiles, in grams,
- **Ww** is the weight of water, in grams,
- **Wec** is the weight of excluded compounds, in grams, and
- **Vm** is the volume of architectural coating, in litres.

**Colourant**

- **(3)** The VOC concentration of an architectural coating must be determined excluding any colourant that is added after the tint base is manufactured or imported, as the case may be, and packaged for sale.




## Test Methods



### Drying Times



**Quick-dry enamel**

**13** 

- **(1)** The set-to-touch, tack-free and dry-hard times of a quick-dry enamel set out in the schedule must be determined in accordance with ASTM D 1640–03, entitled Standard Test Methods for Drying, Curing, or Film Formation of Organic Coatings at Room Temperature, except that the standard must be read as excluding references to any agreement between the purchaser and the seller as well as the following:
	- **(a)** sections 2, 2.1, 4 and 4.1 with the exception of Table 1 of section 4.1;

***varnish*** means a clear or semi-transparent architectural coating, excluding lacquers, formulated to dry by chemical reaction. Varnishes may contain small amounts of pigment to colour a surface or to control the final sheen or gloss of the finish.

**Overview**

- **(2)** The table to this subsection sets out architectural coatings and their applicable VOC concentration limit. The table is divided into three columns. The first sets out the architectural coating subject to the VOC concentration limit, the second sets out the VOC concentration limit applicable to that architectural coating and the third sets out the anniversary of the day on which these Regulations come into force, from which the effective dates of the prohibitions set out in sections 3 and 5 of these Regulations are determined.
