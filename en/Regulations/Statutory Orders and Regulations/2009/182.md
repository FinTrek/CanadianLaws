## Application


**2** 

- **(1)** These Regulations apply to the funding of a defined benefit plan and, except as otherwise provided, the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) also apply to the funding of a plan under these Regulations.

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, a 2008 solvency deficiency shall be calculated in accordance with the definition ***solvency deficiency*** in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) and that definition shall be interpreted, in its paragraph (d), as including the present value of any special payments that are due in the next 10 years and that have been determined before the emergence of the 2008 solvency deficiency.

- **(3)** In the case of an inconsistency between these Regulations and the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), these Regulations prevail.



**3** These Regulations do not apply to a solvency deficiency that emerges as the result of Air Canada electing to fund a plan in accordance with Part 2 of the [Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2004/174.md) other than in respect of a 2008 solvency deficiency that emerges as at the end of the 2008 plan year, despite section 21 of those Regulations.



**4** 

- **(1)** Plans may only be funded under these Regulations if all of the payments that are owed to the pension fund before the day on which the deficiency emerges, as required by subsection 9(14) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), have been made as at the filing date of the actuarial report that shows the emergence of that deficiency.

- **(2)** Despite section 8 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), the funding of a plan shall be considered to meet the standards for solvency if the funding is in accordance with Part 1, 2 or 3 of these Regulations.




**PART 1** 
## Funding



### General Funding Rules


**5** 

- **(1)** Despite subsection 9(4) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) and section 13 of the [Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2004/174.md), a solvency deficiency, as defined in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), of a plan that emerged at the end of the 2008 plan year may be funded in accordance with section 9 of those Regulations but the remittance to the pension fund of a portion of the special payments determined in accordance with those Regulations may be made in accordance with subsection (2) or (3), as the case may be.

- **(2)** If the actuarial report that values the plan as at the end of the 2008 plan year indicates that there is a 2008 solvency deficiency and that there is a solvency deficiency as defined in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), a portion of the special payments determined in accordance with subsection 9(4) of those Regulations or section 13 of the [Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2004/174.md) may be paid to the pension fund as if the 2008 solvency deficiency were funded by special payments sufficient to liquidate the 2008 solvency deficiency by equal annual payments over a period not exceeding 10 years from the day on which the 2008 solvency deficiency emerged.

- **(3)** If the actuarial report that values the plan as at the end of the 2008 plan year indicates that there is no 2008 solvency deficiency but that there is a solvency deficiency as defined in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), the special payments determined in accordance with subsection 9(4) of those Regulations or section 13 of the [Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2004/174.md) may be paid to the pension fund provided that those special payments result in the solvency shortfall being funded and liquidated over a period not exceeding 10 years from the day on which the solvency shortfall was calculated.

- **(4)** For the purposes of subsection 8(1) of the Act, if the 2008 solvency deficiency or solvency shortfall, as the case may be, is calculated by valuing the assets of a plan in excess of 110% of market value as at the date on which the valuation that identified the 2008 solvency deficiency or solvency shortfall was performed, the amount by which the aggregate amount of special payments calculated using a value of assets equal to 110% of market value on that date exceeds the aggregate amount of special payments calculated using a value of assets in excess of 110% of market value on that date shall be considered to be an amount accrued to the pension fund.

- **(5)** The amount that was accrued as a result of subsection (4) is considered to have been paid to the plan at the end of the fifth plan year after the end of the 2009 plan year by special payments that have been calculated in accordance with these Regulations and section 9 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) provided that all those payments have been made to the fund by the end of that plan year.

- **(6)** If the funding is for a deficiency of a multi-employer pension plan and if the annual amount of the payments required to be made to the pension fund in accordance with subsection (2) or (3), as the case may be, is less than the aggregate amount of the payments that are required to be made to the pension fund, excluding the normal cost and the special payments required to liquidate an unfunded liability, under all applicable collective agreements, the amount of the payments required to be made to the pension fund in accordance with subsection (2) or (3), as the case may be, shall be the aggregate amount of the payments required to be made to the pension fund under all applicable collective agreements and subsection (4) shall not apply.
> SOR/2010-149, s. 17.




**6** Before funding the deficiency in accordance with this Part, the administrator shall file the following documents with the Superintendent:
- **(a)** written notification that the deficiency is to be funded in accordance with section 5; and
- **(b)** the actuarial report valuing the plan as at the day on which the deficiency emerged.



**7** For the purposes of paragraph 10.1(2)(b) of the Act, the prescribed solvency ratio level for the 2009 plan year is the solvency ratio calculated on the basis of the actuarial report that reported the deficiency and that was filed with the Superintendent in accordance with subsection 12(3) of the Act.




### Non-application of Parts 2 and 3


**8** 

- **(1)** If Parts 2 and 3 do not apply, section 9 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md) or section 13 of the [Air Canada Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/2004/174.md), as the case may be, applies in respect of the plan after the 2008 plan year except as otherwise provided in this Part.

- **(2)** In respect of the 2009 plan year, the solvency deficiency and solvency special payments shall be determined in accordance with section 9 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md).

	- **(e)** the special payments that would have been made during the first plan year covered by the actuarial report referred to in paragraph 6(b) if the deficiency were to be funded in accordance with section 9 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md);

- **(a)** despite paragraph 9(4)(c) of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985, if there is a solvency deficiency, a plan shall be funded in each plan year by annual solvency special payments equal to the amount by which the solvency deficiency divided by 5 exceeds the amount of going concern special payments — other than those referred to in paragraph 29(1)(c) — that are payable during the plan year; and

- **(2)** If the actuarial report that values the plan as at the end of the 2008 plan year indicates that there is no 2008 solvency deficiency but that there is a solvency deficiency as defined in subsection 9(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), the solvency deficiency may be funded by special payments sufficient to liquidate the solvency shortfall of the plan over a period not exceeding 10 years from the day on which that solvency shortfall was calculated.

- **(3)** The deficiency may be funded in accordance with this Part if the employer
	- **(a)** obtains letters of credit up to the end of the fifth plan year of funding under this Part, for the amount representing the difference between the present value, at the end of each plan year, of the remaining special payments that are required to be made to liquidate the 2008 solvency deficiency or solvency shortfall, as the case may be, under this Part and the present value of the remaining special payments that would have been required to be made to liquidate the corresponding 2008 solvency deficiency or solvency shortfall, as the case may be, as if it had been funded under section 9 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md); and
	- **(b)** maintains letters of credit for the sixth plan year of funding and for each plan year after that year, for the amount representing the present value at the beginning of each plan year of the remaining special payments under this Part.

- **(4)** The present value of the remaining special payments shall be determined by using the interest rate that was assumed in valuing the liabilities of the plan for the purpose of calculating the deficiency.
