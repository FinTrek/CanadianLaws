## Description of the Strip Surfaces

The elevation of a strip surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centreline of that strip surface.


The elevation of the strip surface centreline between the strip surface end and the closest strip surface threshold is equal to the elevation of the strip surface end. The elevation of the strip surface centreline between the strip surface thresholds is calculated using a constant ratio between the elevations of the strip surface thresholds or between the elevations of the points along the runway centreline as provided herein.


The strip surfaces, shown on Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Plan No. 06-006 94-128, Sheets 7, 8, 12, 13, 14 and 18, dated February 20, 1996, are imaginary surfaces associated with an airport runway that are prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction. The strip surfaces are described as follows:

**(a)** the strip surface associated with proposed runway 07R-25L is 300.000 m in total width, being 150.000 m on either side of the centreline of the proposed runway. The strip surface commences 60.000 m to the southwest of threshold 07R and ends 60.000 m to the northeast of threshold 25L, having a total length of 2 559.000 m. The 07R end of the strip surface has an elevation of 100.000 m and the 25L end of the strip surface has an elevation of 105.000 m. The azimuth of the centreline from threshold 07R to threshold 25L is 57°56′36″. Threshold 07R has grid coordinates of 447 897.32 E and 5 016 543.09 N and threshold 25L has grid coordinates of 449 963.64 E and 5 017 837.10 N. There are no additional points between thresholds, along proposed runway 07R-25L, that control the elevation of the proposed runway centreline;



**(b)** the strip surface associated with proposed runway 07C-25C is 732.780 m in total width, being 366.390 m on either side of the centreline of the proposed runway. The strip surface commences 60.000 m to the southwest of threshold 07C and ends 60.000 m to the northeast of threshold 25C, having a total length of 3 001.370 m. The 07C end of the strip surface has an elevation of 100.000 m and the 25C end of the strip surface has an elevation of 105.000 m. The azimuth of the centreline from threshold 07C to threshold 25C is 57°56′36″.
