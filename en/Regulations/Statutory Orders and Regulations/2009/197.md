Date registered: 18 June 2009

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 332(1)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md)<sup><a href='#footnoteb_e'>[b]</a></sup>, the Minister of the Environment published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on April 26, 2008, a copy of the proposed Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Automotive Refinishing Products Regulations, substantially in the form set out in the annexed Regulations, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the proposed Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: S.C. 2004, c. 15, s. 31<br />

<a name='footnoteb_e'><sup>b</sup></a>: S.C. 1999, c. 33<br />

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 93(3) of that Act, the National Advisory Committee has been given an opportunity to provide its advice under section 6<sup><a href='#footnotec_e'>[c]</a></sup> of that Act;

## Determination of VOC Concentration



**Automotive refinishing coating**

**7** The VOC concentration in a coating as set out in the schedule is determined by the following equation:

- **Ws** is the weight of volatiles, in grams;
- **Ww** is the weight of water, in grams;
- **Wec** is the weight of excluded compounds, in grams;
- **Vm** is the volume of coating, in litres;
- **Vw** is the volume of water, in litres; and
- **Vec** is the volume of excluded compounds, in litres.




**Surface cleaner**

**8** The VOC concentration in a surface cleaner as set out in the schedule is determined by the following equation:
```
VOC concentration = (Ws – Ww – Wec) ÷ (Vm)
```
where
- **VOC concentration** is the grams of VOC compounds per litre of surface cleaner, undiluted or diluted in accordance with the written instructions of the manufacturer, importer or seller if required before the product is to be used;
- **Ws** is the weight of volatiles, in grams;
- **Ww** is the weight of water, in grams;
- **Wec** is the weight of excluded compounds, in grams; and
- **Vm** is the volume of surface cleaner, in litres.
