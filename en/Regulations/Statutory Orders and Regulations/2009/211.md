- **(b)** a former member for whom the administrator has purchased an immediate or deferred life annuity. (*bénéficiaire*)

***solvency deficit*** means the amount by which the liabilities of a plan, determined on the basis that the plan is terminated or on a basis that is certified by an actuary to be reasonably approximate to a termination basis and taking into account any significant increases or decreases in benefits to the plan members as a result of the termination, exceed the aggregate of the value of the assets of the plan, determined on the basis of market value. (*déficit de solvabilité*)

***solvency ratio*** means the lesser of one and the ratio of the assets of the plan as determined in accordance with the definition of “solvency deficit” to the liabilities of the plan as determined in accordance with that definition, based on the most recent actuarial report filed with the Superintendent pursuant to section 12 of the Act.
