**5** No drinking vessel with a distinctive exterior decorative pattern within 20 mm of the rim, when tested in accordance with the method set out in item 2 of the schedule, shall release lead in excess of 4 mg/L or cadmium in excess of 0.4 mg/L.
> SOR/2007-30, s. 3.





## Identification and Warning


**6** A product that is not for food use and that releases lead or cadmium in excess of the leachability limits set out in the table to section 4 shall:
- **(a)** be identified by a design feature, such as a hole or a mounting hook, that renders the product unsuitable for the storing, preparing or serving of food; or
- **(b)** display, in both official languages and in capital letters of not less than 3 mm in height, a permanent warning consisting of one of the following texts or a similar text, as may be appropriate:DANGER!

CONTAINS LEAD — *CONTIENT DU PLOMB*



DO NOT USE FOR FOOD — *NE PAS UTILISER POUR LES ALIMENTS*

### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 4 and 5)**
## Test Methods
**1** To determine whether a product releases lead or cadmium, the following method, which is based on the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 6486-1:1999, Ceramic ware, glass-ceramic ware and glass dinnerware in contact with food — Release of lead and cadmium — Part 1: Test Method, second edition, 1999-12-15, shall be used:
- **(a)** handwash the product using a non-acidic detergent solution, rinse with distilled water and air dry;
- **(b)** fill the product to within 5 mm of the level of overflowing with an extraction solution of 4% (volume/volume) of acetic acid in water;
- **(c)** cover the product with an inert opaque cover and allow to stand for 24 hours at 22°C ± 2°C;
- **(d)** stir the extraction solution to ensure homogeneity taking care not to abrade the surface of the product;
- **(e)** take an aliquot of the extraction solution and, within 8 hours, analyze the solution using an analytical technique that is in accordance with good laboratory practices; and
- **(f)** express the results as the quantity of the lead or cadmium in milligrams per litre of the extraction solution.


**2** To determine whether a drinking vessel bearing a distinctive exterior decorative pattern within 20 mm of the rim releases lead or cadmium, the following method, which is based on a standard of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM C927-80), reapproved 2004, Standard Test Method for Lead and Cadmium Extracted from the Lip and Rim Area of Glass Tumblers Externally Decorated with Ceramic Glass Enamels, shall be used:
- **(a)** handwash the drinking vessel using a non-acidic detergent solution, rinse with distilled water and air dry;
- **(b)** measure the internal volume of the drinking vessel in millilitres by filling with distilled water to within 5 mm of the level of overflowing and record the internal volume (V<sub>2</sub>);
- **(c)** discard the water and invert the drinking vessel in an appropriate laboratory glassware container whose diameter is a minimum of 1.25 times and a maximum of 2 times the external diameter of the test specimen as measured at the rim;
- **(d)** add to the laboratory glassware container the volume of an extraction solution of 4% (volume/volume) of acetic acid in water that is sufficient to permit the drinking vessel to be submerged in 20 mm of the solution and record the volume of extraction solution used (V<sub>1</sub>);
- **(e)** cover the laboratory glassware container with an inert opaque cover and allow to stand for 24 hours at 22°C ± 2°C;
- **(f)** remove the drinking vessel and stir the extraction solution to ensure homogeneity;
- **(g)** take an aliquot of the extraction solution and, within 8 hours, analyze the solution using an analytical technique that is in accordance with good laboratory practices; and
- **(h)** express the results as the quantity of the lead or cadmium in milligrams per litre of the extraction solution relative to the internal volume of the drinking vessel as follows:
```
(C × V<sub>1</sub>) / V<sub>2</sub>
```
where
- **C** is the concentration of lead or cadmium in milligrams per litre in the extraction solution,
- **V** <sub>1</sub>is the volume in millilitres of the extraction solution used, and
- **V** <sub>2</sub>is the internal volume in millilitres of the drinking vessel.
