**Where security available**

**416** 

- **(1)** Where, on the motion of a defendant, it appears to the Court that
	- **(a)** the plaintiff is ordinarily resident outside Canada,
	- **(b)** the plaintiff is a corporation, an unincorporated association or a nominal plaintiff and there is reason to believe that the plaintiff would have insufficient assets in Canada available to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so,

	- **(f)** the defendant has an order against the plaintiff for costs in the same or another proceeding that remain unpaid in whole or in part,

the Court may order the plaintiff to give security for the defendant’s costs.

**Staging**

- **(2)** The Court may order that security for the costs of a defendant be given in stages, as costs are incurred.

**Further steps**

- **(3)** Unless the Court orders otherwise, until the security required by an order under subsection (1) or (2) has been given, the plaintiff may not take any further step in the action, other than an appeal from that order.

**Party temporarily resident in Canada**

- **(4)** A party ordinarily resident outside Canada may be ordered to give security for costs, notwithstanding that the party may be temporarily resident in Canada.

**Voluntary payment into court**

**Grounds for refusing security**

**417** The Court may refuse to order that security for costs be given under any of paragraphs 416(1)(a) to (g) if a plaintiff demonstrates impecuniosity and the Court is of the opinion that the case has merit.




**How security to be given**

**418** Where a person is required under these Rules or an Act of Parliament to give security for costs or for any other purpose, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or required by that Act, the person may do so

**Consequences of failure to accept plaintiff’s offer**

**420** 

- **(1)** Unless otherwise ordered by the Court and subject to subsection (3), where a plaintiff makes a written offer to settle and obtains a judgment as favourable or more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, the plaintiff is entitled to party-and-party costs to the date of service of the offer and costs calculated at double that rate, but not double disbursements, after that date.

**Consequences of failure to accept defendant’s offer**

- **(2)** Unless otherwise ordered by the Court and subject to subsection (3), where a defendant makes a written offer to settle,

**Offers without costs**

**420.1** 

- **(1)** In circumstances where a written offer to settle does not provide for the settlement of the issue of costs, if a party requests the Court to consider rule 420, the Court, in ascertaining whether the judgment granted is more or less favourable than the offer to settle, shall not have regard to costs awarded in the judgment or that would otherwise be awarded.

**Application to court**

- **(2)** For greater certainty, if a written offer to settle that does not provide for the settlement of the issue of costs is accepted, a party to the offer may apply to the Court for an order determining costs.

**Offer to contribute**

**421** Subsection 420(2) applies to a third party, or to one of two or more defendants who are alleged to be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in respect of a claim, who makes a written offer to other defendants or third parties to contribute toward a settlement of the claim.




**Disclosure of offer to Court**

**422** No communication respecting an offer to settle or offer to contribute shall be made to the Court, other than to a case management judge or prothonotary assigned under rule 383(c) or to a judge or prothonotary at a pre-trial conference, until all questions of liability and the relief to be granted, other than costs, have been determined.
