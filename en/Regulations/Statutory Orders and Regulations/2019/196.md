### Calculation and Payment of Compensatory Royalty



**Compensatory royalty**

**97** 

- **(1)** The monthly compensatory royalty that is payable by a subsurface contract holder is
	- **(a)** in the case of a vertical triggering well or deviated triggering well that is producing from a single spacing unit, an amount equal to the amount that would have been payable by the holder as a royalty for that month if the triggering well were producing from the adjoining First Nation spacing unit that is in their contract area; and
	- **(b)** in the case of a horizontal triggering well, multilateral triggering well or deviated triggering well that is producing from more than one spacing unit, an amount equal to the percentage, calculated in accordance with the following formula, of the amount referred to in paragraph (a):
```
(L/T) × 100
```
where
- **L** is the length of the section of the triggering well that is located in the adjoining external spacing unit and is capable of producing oil or gas from the offset zone, and
- **T** is the total length of the section of the well that is capable of producing oil or gas.

**Prorated amount**

- **(2)** If the triggering well is located in an external spacing unit that contains First Nation lands, the monthly compensatory royalty that is payable is an amount calculated in accordance with the formula
```
C × (100 – I)/100
```
where
- **C** is the amount of the compensatory royalty that is payable under subsection (1); and
- **I** is the area of the First Nation lands in the spacing unit, expressed as a percentage of the area of that spacing unit.

**Calculation of compensatory royalty**

- **(3)** For the purpose of calculating the monthly compensatory royalty,
	- **(a)** the volume of oil, gas or condensate to be used in the royalty formula is the volume of oil, raw gas or condensate that was produced in the month by the triggering well, as shown by the records of the provincial authority; and
	- **(b)** the price to be used, in respect of that month, is
		- **(i)** in the case of oil, in Saskatchewan, the price indicated in the Monthly Crude Oil Royalty/Tax Factor History, published by the Ministry of Energy and Resources, and, in the other provinces, the monthly par price for light, medium, heavy or ultra heavy oil, as the case may be, published by Alberta’s Department of Energy,
		- **(ii)** in the case of gas, in Saskatchewan, the price indicated in the Monthly Natural Gas Royalty/Tax Factor History, published by the Ministry of Energy and Resources, and, in the other provinces, the Gas Reference Price in the monthly information letter Natural Gas Royalty Prices and Allowances, published by Alberta’s Department of Energy, and
		- **(iii)** in the case of condensate, the Pentanes Plus Reference Price in the monthly information letter Natural Gas Royalty Prices and Allowances, published by Alberta’s Department of Energy.

**Compensatory royalty — confidential well**

- **(4)** In the case of an offset notice sent under paragraph 94(3)(b), the month referred to in paragraph (3)(a) for the first monthly compensatory royalty is the month whose first day follows the period that begins on the day on which the information sent under paragraph 94(3)(a) is received and ends on the 180th day after that day. For each subsequent monthly compensatory royalty, the month is each subsequent month.

**Heating value**

- **(5)** If the royalty calculation requires the conversion of a price in dollars per gigajoule (GJ) into a price in dollars per 1000 m<sup>3</sup>, the heating value is 37.7 GJ/1000 m<sup>3</sup>.

**No deduction**

- **(6)** No deduction for costs or allowances is to be made in the calculation of the compensatory royalty.

**Transitional provision**

- **(7)** This section does not apply to a compensatory royalty owing under the [Indian Oil and Gas Regulations, 1995](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/94/753.md).




**Calculation and payment of compensatory royalty**

**98** On or before the 25th day of the third month after the month in which the obligation to pay the compensatory royalty begins, and on or before the 25th day of each subsequent month, the subsurface contract holder must pay the Minister the monthly compensatory royalty and, in the prescribed form, provide the information that is required to verify its calculation.




**Amended spacing unit**

**99** The obligation to pay a compensatory royalty continues despite any change in the size of the First Nation spacing unit or the external spacing unit in which the triggering well is located if the two spacing units remain adjoined.




**End of obligation to pay**

**100** 

- **(1)** The obligation to pay a compensatory royalty ends if the subsurface contract holder
	- **(a)** establishes any of the circumstances set out in subsection 96(1); or
	- **(b)** surrenders their rights or interests down to the base of the offset zone in the spacing unit to which the offset notice applies, except for any rights or interests in a zone from which a well is productive or that is subject to a unit agreement or to a storage agreement that has been approved by the provincial authority.

**Notice to holder**

- **(2)** After determining whether a circumstance set out in subsection 96(1) has been established, the Minister must send the holder a notice informing them of his or her determination and, if the obligation ends, the day on which it ends.

**Final day of obligation**

- **(3)** The obligation to pay a compensatory royalty ends
	- **(a)** if the holder sends the Minister a notice establishing a circumstance set out in subsection 96(1), on the first day of the month in which the Minister receives the notice; or
	- **(b)** if the holder has surrendered their rights or interests, on the first day of the month that follows the month in which the Minister receives a notice of the surrender.

**Notice to council**

- **(4)** If the obligation to pay a compensatory royalty ends, the Minister must send the council a notice indicating that it has ended and the reasons that it has ended.




**Exception**

**101** Subject to subsection 97(7), sections 93 to 100 and 111 apply to any subsurface contract that was granted under the [Indian Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/I/I-5.md) or the Act.

### **SCHEDULE 4** 
**(Subsections 1(1) and 63(1))**
## Zones — Continuation

**Definitions**

**1** The following definitions apply in this Schedule.

***ILND*** means the internal limit of a zone, whether upper or lower, that is not defined. (*LIND*)

***KB*** means kelly bushing, which serves as the point on the rotary drilling table from which downhole well log depths are measured. (*FE*)

***NDE*** means not deep enough and, in relation to a reference well, means that the well was not drilled to a depth that was sufficient to penetrate the upper or lower limit of a particular zone. (*FI*)

***NP*** means not present and, in relation to a zone, means that the zone is not present at the location where the reference well was drilled. (*NP*)

***TVD*** means true vertical depth. (*PVR*)



**Zones**

**2** 

- **(1)** In the case of a contract that is continued on the basis of any of paragraphs 63(1)(a) to (g) or under section 66 of these Regulations, for each of the First Nation lands set out in this Schedule, the zones with respect to which continuation may be sought are the zones set out in column 1 of the table that correspond to the well log data set out in column 2.

**Multiple logs**

- **(2)** If there is more than one set of well log data set out in column 2 for a zone, the set derived from the reference well that is nearest to the relevant spacing unit must be used to determine the zones that may be continued.



**Unidentified zone**

**3** If the zone with respect to which the contract may be continued is not identified in a table to this Schedule, the Minister must determine the upper and lower limits of the relevant zone, based on a review of well log data that relate to wells in the vicinity of the relevant spacing unit and on any other well log data that are available and relate to lands in the vicinity.

### **SCHEDULE 5** 
**(Subsection 79(1))**
## Royalties

### Interpretation


**Definition of marketable gas**

**1** In this Schedule, ***marketable gas*** means gas, consisting mainly of methane, that meets industry or utility specifications for use as a domestic, commercial or industrial fuel or as an industrial raw material.



### Actual Selling Price


**Highest value**

**2** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of this Schedule, if the Minister determines that the actual selling price of oil or gas is less than the fair value of that oil or gas at the time and place of production, the actual selling price is deemed to be that fair value. In that case, the Minister must send the contract holder notice of the royalties payable and, within 30 days after the day on which the notice is received, the holder must pay the royalties payable in accordance with that notice.

**Factors to consider**

- **(2)** In determining the fair value of oil or gas, the Minister, in consultation with the council, must take into account the following factors:
	- **(a)** any applicable reference price;
	- **(b)** in the case of gas, transportation cost, volume of fuel gas and heat value;
	- **(c)** in the case of oil, transportation cost, quality adjustment for sulphur content and density;
	- **(d)** whether the parties to the transaction are related parties within the meaning of subsection 82(4) of these Regulations;
	- **(e)** the Bank of Canada’s daily exchange rate for converting U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars; and
	- **(f)** the factor of 6.2898 to convert barrels of oil to cubic metres of oil.



### Oil Royalty


**Calculation of royalty — oil**

**3** 

- **(1)** The royalty on oil that is recovered from, or attributed to, lands in a contract area consists of the basic royalty determined in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) and the supplementary royalty determined in accordance with subsection (5). All amounts are to be calculated at the time and place of production.

**Basic royalty — first five years**

- **(2)** During the five-year period beginning on the day on which production of oil from the contract area begins, the basic royalty for each month of that period is equal to the actual selling price multiplied by the monthly royalty determined in accordance with column 2 of the table to this subsection, based on the monthly production, referred to in column 1, of oil that is recovered from, or attributed to, each well.

</tr>
</table>


**Basic royalty — subsequent years**

- **(3)** Beginning immediately after the period referred to in subsection (2), the basic royalty for each subsequent month is equal to the actual selling price multiplied by the monthly royalty determined in accordance with column 2 of the table to this subsection, based on the monthly production, referred to in column 1, of oil that is recovered from, or attributed to, each well.

- **R** is the reference price, equal to
	- **(i)** in the case of oil recovered from a source set out in column 2 of the table to this subsection, the price set out in column 3, and
	- **(ii)** in any other case, $25 per cubic metre; and
	- **(b)** in respect of oil to which subsection (3) applies, the amount determined by the formula
```
(T – B)[0.75(P – R – $12.58) + $6.29]
```
where
- **T** is the amount of oil, in cubic metres, that is recovered from, or attributed to, each well in the contract area during the month,
- **B** is the monthly royalty, in cubic metres, determined in accordance with the table to subsection (3),
- **P** is the actual selling price of the oil per cubic metre, and
- **R** is the reference price, equal to
	- **(i)** in the case of oil recovered from a source set out in column 2 of the table to this subsection, the price set out in column 3, and

### Gas Royalty


**Calculation of royalty — gas**

**4** 

- **(1)** When gas that is recovered from, or attributed to, lands in a contract area is sold, the royalty payable is the gross royalty value of the gas, determined in accordance with subsection (2), less the portion of the cost of gathering, dehydrating, compressing and processing the gas that is equal to its gross royalty value divided by its total value.

**Gross royalty**

- **(2)** The gross royalty value of gas that is recovered from, or attributed to, lands in the contract area is the basic gross royalty value of 25% of the quantity of that gas multiplied by the actual selling price plus the supplementary gross royalty value determined in accordance with subsection (3). All amounts are to be calculated at the time and place of production.

**Supplementary gross royalty**

- **(3)** The supplementary gross royalty value of gas, individually determined for each gas component produced, is equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying 75% of the quantity of each gas component by
	- **(a)** in the case of marketable gas,
		- **(i)** if the actual selling price exceeds $10.65/1000 m<sup>3</sup> but does not exceed $24.85/1000 m<sup>3</sup>, 30% of the difference between the actual selling price per 1000 m<sup>3</sup> and $10.65/1000 m<sup>3</sup>, or
		- **(ii)** if the actual selling price exceeds $24.85/1000 m<sup>3</sup>, $4.26/1000 m<sup>3</sup> plus 55% of the portion of the actual selling price in excess of $24.85/1000 m<sup>3</sup>;
	- **(b)** in the case of pentanes plus, if the actual selling price exceeds $27.68/m<sup>3</sup>, 50% of the portion of the actual selling price in excess of $27.68/m<sup>3</sup>;
	- **(c)** in the case of sulphur, if the actual selling price exceeds $39.37/t, 50% of the portion of the actual selling price in excess of $39.37/t;
	- **(d)** in the case of other components from a source that produces marketable gas, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the actual selling price of each of those components by the percentage by which the overall royalty rate for marketable gas, taking both basic and supplementary gross royalty values into account, exceeds 25%; and
	- **(e)** in the case of other components from a source that does not produce marketable gas, the lesser of one third of the actual selling price of that component and the amount determined under any special agreement entered into under subsection 4(2) of the Act.

**Measurement of volumes**

- **(4)** For the purposes of this section, volumes referred to are volumes measured at standard conditions of 101.325 kPa and 15°C.

**Notice to council**

- **(5)** The Minister must send the council notice of any costs that are deducted under subsection (1) for gathering, dehydrating, compressing and processing.



### Royalty on Oil or Gas Consumed


**No royalty payable**

**5** 

- **(1)** Despite sections 2 to 4, the royalty payable on oil or gas recovered from, or attributed to, lands in a contract area is nil if the oil or gas is consumed in drilling for, producing or processing oil or gas that is recovered from, or attributed to, those lands.

**Royalty payable**

- **(2)** However, subsection (1) does not apply to oil or gas that is consumed in the production or processing of crude bitumen.
