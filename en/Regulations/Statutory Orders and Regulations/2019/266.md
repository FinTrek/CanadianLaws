**More than one person responsible — paragraph 1(a)**

- **(2)** If more than one person is responsible for the elements referred to in subparagraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) as an owner or otherwise, including having the charge, management or control of, or as the true decision maker with respect to their operations, those elements are only included in the definition of facility if there is at least one person who is responsible for, owns, has the charge management or control of, or is the true decision maker in common.

**More than one person responsible — paragraph 1(b)**

- **(3)** If more than one person is responsible for the pipelines and associated installations or equipment referred to in paragraph (1)(b) as an owner or otherwise, including having the charge, management or control of, or as the true decision maker with respect to the pipelines and associated installations or equipment, those pipelines and associated installations or equipment are only included in the definition of facility if there is at least one person who is responsible for, owns, has the charge management or control of, or is the true decision maker in common.

**Single facility**

- **(4)** If two or more facilities referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition facility in subsection (1) within the same province have the same person responsible, or, if they have more than one person responsible, they have at least one person responsible in common, and are operated in an integrated way, they are deemed to be a single facility.

**Interpretation**

- **(5)** With respect to a facility
	- **(a)** any part of a public road or of a railway track that is bordered on both sides by the facility and used to carry out the facility’s industrial activities is deemed to be part of the facility;
	- **(b)** for greater certainty, any part of a railway track that is used exclusively to carry out the facility’s industrial activities is part of the facility;
	- **(c)** for greater certainty, buildings that are used for legal, administrative or management purposes and that are not located where an industrial activity is carried out are not included for the purposes of the definition of facility; and
	- **(d)** if two or more facilities referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition facility in subsection (1), within the same province, have the same person responsible or a person responsible in common and are not operated in an integrated way, they each constitute a separate facility.

- **(1)** Direct-only complexity weighted barrels (direct-only CWB) is quantified in accordance with the method outlined in the directive entitled CAN-CWB Methodology for Regulatory Support: Public Report, published by Solomon Associates in January 2014.

- **(2)** In the method referred to in subsection (1),
	- **(a)** the value of “Sales and Exports of Steam and Electricity” must be set to zero;
	- **(b)** the value of “EC Reported CO<sub>2</sub>e Site Emissions” excludes
		- **(i)** the emissions associated with electricity generated at the covered facility, and
		- **(ii)** the emissions associated with steam generated but not used by the covered facility;
	- **(c)** the value of “Deemed Indirect CO<sub>2</sub>e Emissions from imported electricity”
		- **(i)** includes emissions associated with electricity that is generated and used at the covered facility, and
		- **(ii)** is calculated using 0.420 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e per MWh of electricity bought;
	- **(d)** the value of “Deemed Indirect CO<sub>2</sub>e Emissions from imported steam” is equal to 0; and
	- **(e)** the value of the “CWB factor” used to calculate hydrogen generation, in all cases, is 5.7.

### Quantification of Production

**1** 

- **(1)** Production by the covered facility, expressed in MWh, is the sum of the amounts determined by the following formula for each of the drivers operated by the covered facility:
```
P<sub>x</sub> × L<sub>x</sub>× H<sub>x</sub>
```
where
- **P** is the rated brake power of driver “x”, expressed in megawatts;
- **L** is the actual annual average percent load of driver “x”, or, if the actual annual average percent load is unavailable, the percentage determined by the formula:
```
rpm<sub>avg</sub> /rpm<sub>max</sub>
```
where
- **rpm** <sub>avg</sub>is the actual annual average speed during operation of driver “x”, expressed in revolutions per minute, and
- **rpm** <sub>max</sub>is the maximum rated speed of driver “x”, expressed in revolutions per minute;
- **H** is the number of hours during the compliance period that driver “x” was operated; and

- **(2)** The following definitions apply in this section.

***driver*** means an electric motor, reciprocating engine or turbine used to drive a compressor. (*conducteur*)

***rated brake power*** means the maximum brake power of a driver as specified by its manufacturer either on its nameplate or otherwise. (*puissance au frein nominale*)

### Quantification of Production

**1** Production is quantified at the end of the formulation step of the manufacturing process, in litres of vaccine, as follows:

(The summation of the products of Ai and Bi for each tank “i”)

```

> [*RENDERING ERROR*: Inline image has no description.]

```
where:
- **A** is the capacity of each tank “i” that is used to combine ingredients at that step, expressed in litres;
- **B** is the number of batches produced in tank “i”; and
- **i** is the i<sup>th</sup> tank where “i” goes from 1 to n where n is the total number tanks used to combine ingredients.

	- **(a)** in the case of pulp, including dissolving pulp for viscose,
		- **(i)** if the moisture content exceeds 10%, the weight of the pulp is adjusted so that its moisture content does not exceed 10%, and
		- **(ii)** if the moisture content is equal to or less than 10%, the weight of the pulp without adjustment; and
	- **(b)** in the case of a finished product or specialty product referred to in subsection (3) derived directly from pulp or the pulping process, the weight of the product or, if it has been machine dried, its weight after it has been dried.

- **(2)** A finished product referred to in paragraph (1)(b) does not include pulping liquor, wood waste, non-condensable gases, sludge, tall oil, turpentine, biogas, steam, water or products that are used in the production process.

- **(3)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a specialty product means abrasive paper base, food grade grease resistant paper, packaging waxed paper base, paper for medical applications, napkin paper for commercial use, towel paper for commercial or domestic use, bath paper for domestic use and facial paper for domestic use.
