		- **(i)** the three most recent reports tabled in respect of the fee before the first day of the current fiscal year set out no more than $500,000 of annual revenue received from that fee,
		- **(ii)** the fee has been adjusted since the tabling of the most recent report in respect of it and the three most recent reports tabled in respect of it set out no more than $500,000 of annual revenue received from that fee,
		- **(iii)** there have not been three reports in respect of the fee and the fee has, at no time since the day on which these Regulations came into force, been more than $151 or referred to in Schedule 2, or
		- **(iv)** the fee was previously considered a low-materiality fee in accordance with paragraph (a), subparagraphs (i) to (iii) or paragraph (c) and has not since ceased to be a low-materiality fee in accordance with section 3; and
	- **(c)** the fees referred to in Schedule 1.

**Exceptions**

- **(2)** Paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) do not apply to
	- **(a)** any fee the amount of which is determined by a formula; and
	- **(b)** the fees referred to in Schedule 2.




**Cessation of low-materiality**

**3** 

- **(1)** A low-materiality fee ceases to be a low-materiality fee on
	- **(a)** the day on which it is increased to $151 or more;
	- **(b)** if the fee is $51 or more but less than $151, the first day of the fiscal year after the tabling of a third consecutive report setting out more than $500,000 of annual revenue received from that fee;
	- **(c)** the day on which it is adjusted, if the adjusted fee is $51 or more but less than $151 and the three most recent reports tabled in respect of the fee set out more than $500,000 of annual revenue received from that fee;
	- **(d)** the day on which it is added to Schedule 2; or
	- **(e)** the day on which it is removed from Schedule 1 if

## Transitional Provision



**Fees from $51 to $151**

**4** Despite subparagraph 2(1)(b)(iii), a fee that is $51 or more but less than $151 is not, unless it is referred to in Schedule 1, considered to be a low-materiality fee if, during the one-year period before the day on which these Regulations come into force, a report setting out more than $500,000 of revenue received from that fee was tabled or a document to the same effect was published on the website of the federal entity in relation to which the fee was fixed.
