Enabling authorities: 
- [CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md)

Date registered: 1 February 2000

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 48(1) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup>, the Minister of the Environment published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on June 5, 1999, a copy of the proposed Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations, substantially in the annexed form, and persons were given an opportunity to file comments with respect to the Regulations or to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 16 (4th Supp.) <br />

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 34(1)<sup><a href='#footnoteb_e'>[b]</a></sup> of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup>[a]</sup>, the federal-provincial advisory committee has been given an opportunity to provide its advice under section 6 of that Act;

<a name='footnoteb_e'><sup>b</sup></a>: S.C. 1989, c. 9, s. 2<br />

And whereas, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, pursuant to subsection 34(3) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup>[a]</sup>, the proposed Regulations do not regulate an aspect of a substance that is regulated by or under any other Act of Parliament;

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health, pursuant to subsection 34(1) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup>[a]</sup>, hereby makes the annexed Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations.




## Interpretation


**1** The definitions in this section apply in these Regulations.

***gasoline*** means
- **(a)** a fuel that is sold or represented as gasoline; or
- **(b)** a petroleum distillate, or a mixture of petroleum distillates, oxygenates or additives, that is suitable for use in a spark ignition engine and that has the following characteristics, as determined by the applicable test method listed in the National Standard of Canada standard CAN/CGSB-3.5-94, Unleaded Automotive Gasoline, as amended from time to time:
	- **(i)** a vapour pressure of at least 38 kPa,
	- **(ii)** an antiknock index of at least 80,
	- **(iii)** a distillation temperature, at which 10% of the fuel has evaporated, of not less than 35°C and not greater than 70°C, and
	- **(iv)** a distillation temperature, at which 50% of the fuel has evaporated, of not less than 65°C and not greater than 120°C. (*essence*)

***gasoline blend*** means any mixture of gasoline and oxygenate that is suitable for use in a spark ignition engine. (*mélange d’essence*)

***heavy-duty vehicle*** means an on-road vehicle that has
- **(a)** a maximum design loaded weight rating specified by a manufacturer of more than 3856 kg;
- **(b)** a curb weight of more than 2722 kg; or
- **(c)** an area enclosed by the geometric projection of the basic vehicle, which includes tires but does not include mirrors or air deflectors, along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle onto a plane perpendicular to that axis, of more than 4.2 m<sup>2</sup>. (*véhicule lourd*)

***on-road vehicle*** means any self-propelled vehicle that is designed to be driven on roads. (*véhicule routier*)

***oxygenate*** means an oxygen-containing, ashless, organic compound that, when added to gasoline, increases the oxygen content in the gasoline. (*produit oxygéné*)

***retailer*** means any person who owns or operates any establishment at which gasoline or a gasoline blend is sold or offered for sale for use in an on-road vehicle. (*détaillant*)

***wholesale purchaser-consumer*** means any person that is not a retailer and that stores gasoline or a gasoline blend in a storage tank of at least 2100 L for use in an on-road vehicle. (*grossiste acheteur-consommateur*)




## Application


**2** These Regulations apply to the flow rate from any nozzle that is used to dispense gasoline, or a gasoline blend, that contains benzene, but do not apply to the flow rate from any nozzle that is used exclusively to dispense gasoline or a gasoline blend into heavy-duty vehicles.




## Maximum Dispensing Flow Rate


**3** No retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall use or offer for use a nozzle to dispense gasoline or a gasoline blend into an on-road vehicle if the flow rate from the nozzle exceeds 38 L/min.




## Method of Determining Dispensing Flow Rate


**4** 

- **(1)** A person shall determine the flow rate referred to in section 3 by measuring the amount of time it takes to dispense 10.0 L of gasoline or a gasoline blend from the nozzle with the nozzle operated at the maximum flow rate.

- **(2)** In making the determination referred to in subsection (1), the person shall
	- **(a)** use a digital stopwatch that reads to at least 0.01 seconds to measure the dispensing time;
	- **(b)** use the dispenser’s volume meter to measure the dispensed volume of gasoline or gasoline blend; and
	- **(c)** start the stopwatch when the dispenser’s volume meter indicates that 2.0 L of gasoline or gasoline blend have been dispensed.

- **(3)** The person shall use the following formula to calculate the dispensing flow rate of gasoline or a gasoline blend from the nozzle, in litres per minute:
```
Flow Rate = 60 × [V<sub>f</sub> - V<sub>i</sub>]/[T<sub>f</sub> - T<sub>i</sub>]
```
where
- **T** <sub>i</sub>is the reading of the stopwatch, in seconds, when the person starts the stopwatch;
- **T** <sub>f</sub>is the reading of the stopwatch, in seconds, when the person stops the stopwatch;
- **V** <sub>i</sub>is the reading of the dispenser’s volume meter, in litres, when the person starts the stopwatch; and
- **V** <sub>f</sub>is the reading of the dispenser’s volume meter, in litres, when the person stops the stopwatch.




## Coming into Force


**5** These Regulations come into force 12 months after the day on which they are registered.
