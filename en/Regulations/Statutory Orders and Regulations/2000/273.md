**Exemption — functional relationship of certain emissions**

- **(11)** A manufacturer may apply to the Minister for an exemption from the requirement to submit the report referred to in subsection (1) in respect of the emissions that are contained in the smoke produced from a particular brand of cigarettes that is sold in a year, on or before December 1 of the year before the year for which the exemption is sought, if the manufacturer provides to the Minister, with respect to emissions contained in the sidestream smoke, the information contained in subsection (2) and, with respect to the emissions contained in the mainstream smoke, the same information as well as the contents and results of a statistical analysis done under the conditions set out in paragraph (6)(b) that demonstrates, within a 95% confidence limit and in relation to the type of emission exemption sought, the existence of a functional linear relationship
	- **(a)** between tar and each of the other emissions, other than nicotine, produced from the combustion of the cigarettes
		- **(i)** by using the formula
```
y = mx + b
```
where
		- **y** is the amount of the other emission,
		- **m** is the slope,
		- **x** is the mean amount of tar as determined by 7 replicates, and
