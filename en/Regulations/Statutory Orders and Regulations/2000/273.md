**Exception — short report**

- **(9)** A manufacturer may, instead of submitting the report described in subsection (1) for a designated tobacco product, submit, every two years, a report on the amount of tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, benzene, hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde emissions contained in the smoke produced from the designated tobacco product if
	- **(a)** in respect of cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and tobacco sticks, including any cigarettes, cigarette tobacco or tobacco sticks sold in kits, the manufacturer’s total sales for that product in the year preceding the period covered by the report is less than 1% of the total sales of that product in that year in Canada; and

	- **(a)** the product is one of identical products of the manufacturer sold under different brands; and
	- **(b)** a report under this section is submitted in respect of another of those identical products.

**Exemption — functional relationship of certain emissions**

- **(11)** A manufacturer may, on or before December 1 of the year preceding the year for which the exemption is sought, apply to the Minister for an exemption from the requirement to submit a report under subsection (1) in respect of the emissions for mainstream or sidestream smoke of a brand of a designated tobacco product specified by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer provides to the Minister the content and results of a statistical analysis done under the conditions referred to in subsection (12), that demonstrates, within a 95% confidence limit and in relation to the type of emission exemption sought, the existence of a functional linear relationship
	- **(a)** between tar and each of the other emissions, other than nicotine, produced from the combustion of the designated tobacco product
		- **(i)** by using the following formula:
```
y=mx+b
```
where
- **y** is the amount of the other emission,
- **m** is the slope,
- **x** is the mean amount of tar as determined by 7 replicates, and
- **b** is the intercept,
		- **(ii)** by applying a regression analysis to the results obtained under subparagraph (i), and
		- **(iii)** by applying an F-test to the results obtained under that subparagraph; and
	- **(b)** between nicotine and the other emissions produced from the combustion of the designated tobacco product, by making the calculation and applying the analysis and test described in paragraph (a), except that the references to “tar” in subparagraph (i), other than in the description of “y”, shall be read as references to “nicotine”.

**Conditions**

- **(12)** The conditions under which the statistical analysis to be provided in subsection (11) are as follows:
	- **(a)** in the case of mainstream smoke, under the conditions set out in paragraphs (6)(a) and (b); and
	- **(b)** in the case of sidestream smoke, under the conditions set out in paragraph (6)(a).

**Sample size**

- **(13)** To qualify for an exemption under subsection (11), the manufacturer must submit to the Minister
	- **(a)** a sample that must be composed of at least 28 different brands and 2 standard samples of a type of the designated tobacco product that represent the range of tar and nicotine deliveries for that type of designated tobacco product as determined
		- **(i)** in the case of mainstream smoke, in accordance with Official Method T-115, entitled Determination of “Tar”, Nicotine and Carbon Monoxide in Mainstream Tobacco Smoke, made by the Department of Health, dated December 31, 1999, and
		- **(ii)** in the case of sidestream smoke, in accordance with Official Method T-212 entitled Determination of “Tar” and Nicotine in Sidestream Tobacco Smoke, made by the Department of Health, dated December 31, 1999;
	- **(b)** a list of the brands of the designated tobacco product for which the application for exemption is made; and
	- **(c)** a list of the properties of the designated tobacco product, such as the type of tobacco, type of filter and characteristics of a cigarette paper, which demonstrate the functional linear relationship between
		- **(i)** the brands of the designated tobacco product that form the sample, and
		- **(ii)** one or more of the brands of the designated tobacco product for which the application for exemption is made.

**Joint Sample**

- **(14)** For the purpose of subsection (13), two or more manufacturers may combine their designated tobacco products to produce a joint sample for the purpose of analyzing the sample in accordance with that subsection.

**Decision of the Minister**

- **(15)** The Minister shall, without delay, decide to accept or reject
	- **(a)** an application made under subsection (11), based on the
		- **(i)** methodology used, and
		- **(ii)** the demonstration of a satisfactory functional linear relationship based on
			- **(A)** the mean and standard deviations of the amount of each of the emissions, other than tar and nicotine,
			- **(B)** the estimates and 95% confidence limits for the slope “m” and the intercept “b” referred to in subparagraph (11)(a)(i),
			- **(C)** regression statistics, including the degree of freedom for error, degree of freedom for regression, mean square regression, mean square error and the F statistic, and
			- **(D)** the fact that the data must fall under a 95% prediction interval; and
	- **(b)** a sample made in accordance with subsection (13) or (14), based on the methodology used and the representativeness of the sample.

**Satisfactory functional relationship**

- **(16)** For the purposes of paragraph (15)(a), a satisfactory functional linear relationship exists if a linear model demonstrates a significant portion of the variation of the other emissions about the mean of those other emissions, with a statistical significance of less than 0.01.
