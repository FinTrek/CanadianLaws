	- **(b)** the person is no longer employed by or otherwise under contract to the licensee;
	- **(c)** the duties or functions of the person have been completed, suspended or otherwise terminated; or
	- **(d)** the facility-access security clearance is no longer required by the person in order for them to perform their duties.

- **(2)** A licensee shall immediately notify the Commission in writing of any revocation made under paragraph (1)(a).
> SOR/2006-191, s. 32.





### Entry of Land Vehicles


**45** No licensee shall permit a land vehicle to enter a nuclear facility unless
- **(a)** there is an operational requirement for it to be there and it is searched for explosive substances, weapons and unauthorized persons; or
- **(b)** it is used by a member of an off-site response force, a peace officer or a member of another external emergency response force for the purpose of carrying out their duties.
> SOR/2006-191, s. 32.





### Security of Nuclear Substances


**46** 

- **(1)** Every licensee shall process, use and store nuclear substances and other radioactive material in an area within a nuclear facility that is under the visual surveillance of the licensee, or is designed and constructed to prevent persons from gaining unauthorized access to those substances and that material.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), a licensee shall ensure that the area is equipped with devices that
	- **(a)** detect any intrusion into it;
	- **(b)** detect any tampering that may cause any of the devices to malfunction or cease to function; and
	- **(c)** when an event referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) is detected, set off a continuous alarm signal that is both audible and visible to a person in the service of the licensee or of an alarm monitoring service under contract to the licensee.

- **(3)** A licensee need not comply with subsection (2) if it takes physical protection measures in respect of the area that provide the same level of protection as the devices referred to in that subsection.
> SOR/2006-191, s. 32.





### Arrangements with Off-site Response Force


**47** 

- **(1)** Every licensee shall make or cause to be made written arrangements with an off-site response force that is capable of making an effective intervention at the nuclear facility.

- **(2)** The arrangements shall include provisions for
	- **(a)** annual familiarization visits to the nuclear facility by members of the off-site response force; and
	- **(b)** the joint development of a contingency plan by the licensee and the off-site response force to facilitate the force making an effective intervention.

- **(3)** If a licensee does not have alarm monitoring capability, the alarm monitoring service under contract to the licensee shall notify the licensee and the off-site response force, immediately on receipt of an alarm signal from the nuclear facility or the area referred to in subsection 46(1).
> SOR/2006-191, s. 32.





### Supervisory Awareness Program


**48** Every licensee shall develop a supervisory awareness program and implement it on an ongoing basis to ensure that its supervisors are trained to recognize behavioural changes in all personnel, including contractors, that could pose a risk to security at a facility at which it carries on licensed activities.
> SOR/2006-191, s. 32.
