**Allocation of remaining shortfall**

**57** 

- **(1)** If the amounts credited or deposited into the settlement account under sections 55 and 56 do not eliminate the shortfall in the account, the direct clearers and group clearers that are not in default and the Bank of Canada shall each deposit into the account the amount determined by the following formula:
```
A x B/C
```
where, for a given direct clearer or group clearer that is not in default or the Bank of Canada,
- **A** is the remaining amount of the shortfall;
- **B** is the value of the payment items that the given direct clearer or group clearer or the Bank of Canada entered into the ACSS during the ACSS cycle prior to the default that are drawn on or payable by the direct clearer or group clearer that is in default; and
- **C** is the total value of payment items that were entered into the ACSS during that cycle by all direct clearers and group clearers that are not in default and by the Bank of Canada and that are drawn on or payable by the direct clearer or group clearer that is in default.

**Interest**

- **(2)** The amount deposited in accordance with subsection (1) shall bear interest at the rate specified in the rules.

**Right of recovery**

- **(3)** The amount deposited and the interest on it constitute a debt that is immediately due and payable by the direct clearer or group clearer that is in default to the direct clearer, group clearer or the Bank of Canada, as the case may be.




#### Default of Indirect Clearer



**Default of indirect clearer**

**58** An indirect clearer is in default in respect of its clearing agent for the purposes of this By-law if
- **(a)** the settlement account of the indirect clearer with its clearing agent has a shortfall that would preclude settlement; and
- **(b)** the indirect clearer does not obtain an advance sufficient for settlement.




**Remittance of payment items**

**59** The indirect clearer that is in default shall remit to its clearing agent all payment items that have already been sent to the indirect clearer by the clearing agent that are drawn on or payable by the indirect clearer.




**Return of payment items**

**60** The clearing agent in respect of which the indirect clearer is in default shall return, in accordance with the rules, all payment items that it is able to return, including those not giving rise to clearing through the ACSS, that are drawn on or payable by the indirect clearer that is in default.




#### Exception — Returns and Entries into the ACSS



**Payment items not returned**

**61** Despite sections 54 and 60, members shall not return payment items if the exchange of those payment items has become irrevocable and irreversible pursuant to section 14.




**Prohibition**

**62** A direct clearer or group clearer that is in default shall not make entries into the ACSS, other than those in relation to the return of payment items under section 54.
