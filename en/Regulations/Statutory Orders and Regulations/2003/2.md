### Calculation of Fleet Average NOx Values


**24** 

- **(1)** Subject to section 25, for each of its fleets referred to in sections 21 to 23, a company shall calculate the average NOx value in accordance with the following formula:
```
[Σ (A x B)]/C
```
where
- **A** is the NOx emission standard for each full useful life emission bin,
- **B** is the number of vehicles in the fleet that conform to that NOx emission standard, and
- **C** is the total number of vehicles in the fleet.

- **(2)** The average NOx value for the fleet shall be rounded to the same number of significant figures that are contained in the total number of vehicles in the fleet in the denominator in subsection (1), but to at least three decimal places.

- **(3)** If a company’s fleet includes any hybrid electric vehicle that is covered by an EPA certificate, the average NOx value calculated under subsection (1) may be lowered by applying one or more hybrid electric vehicle NOx contribution factors as long as
	- **(a)** each factor has been approved by the EPA in accordance with the provisions of the CFR;
	- **(b)** each factor is applied in the same manner as it is applied by the EPA; and
	- **(c)** evidence of the EPA approval is provided to the Minister in the end of model year report referred to in section 32.

- **(4)** Subject to subsection (5), in respect of any of its vehicles that conform to a NOx emission standard for an extended useful life of 15 years or 240,000 km (150,000 miles), a company may, in the equation in subsection (1), replace that standard, for each of those vehicles, with that standard multiplied by 0.85, rounded to at least three decimal places.

- **(5)** A company may only replace a NOx emission standard as described in subsection (4) if the vehicle complies with any standards that may be applicable at the intermediate useful life.

- **(6)** In respect of the 2004 and 2005 model years, a company may multiply by 2 the number of vehicles that conform to full useful life emission bin 1, and multiply by 1.5 the number of vehicles that conform to full useful life emission bin 2, when calculating one of the following:
	- **(a)** the denominator in subsection (1); or
	- **(b)** “total number of vehicles in the fleet” in the equation for calculating credits in subsection 26(2).

- **(7)** When calculating the average NOx value under subsection (1) for a fleet of the 2004 model year, a company may include all vehicles of that model year, including those manufactured before January 1, 2004.



**25** 

- **(1)** A company may elect not to calculate an average NOx value for a fleet of a specific model year if every vehicle in that fleet conforms to a full useful life emission bin that has a NOx standard equal to or less than the applicable fleet average NOx standard for that model year that is set out in section 21, 22 or 23.

- **(2)** For the purposes of section 26 and paragraphs 32(2)(b) and 37(1)(c), the average NOx emission value in respect of a fleet in a model year when a company makes an election under subsection (1) shall be deemed to be the fleet average NOx standard applicable to the fleet for which the election was made.




### NOx Emission Credits


**26** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of subparagraph 162(1)(b)(i) of the Act, a company shall obtain NOx emission credits if the average NOx value in respect of a fleet of a specific model year is lower than the fleet average NOx standard for that model year and the company reports the credits under paragraph 32(2)(e).

- **(2)** NOx emission credits, expressed in units of vehicle-grams per mile, shall be calculated using the following formula, rounding the result to the nearest whole number:
```
(A - B) x C
```
where
- **A** is the fleet average NOx standard
- **B** is the average NOx value in respect of the fleet, and
- **C** is the total number of vehicles in the fleet.

- **(3)** The NOx emission credits for a specific model year are credited on the last day of that model year.



**27** NOx emission credits obtained in a specific model year shall be used by the company to offset any outstanding NOx emission deficit described in section 28, and any remaining credits may be used to offset a future deficit or may be transferred to another company.




### NOx Emission Deficits


**28** Subject to section 31, if a company’s average NO<sub>x</sub> value in respect of a fleet of a specific model year is higher than the fleet average NO<sub>x</sub> standard for that model year, the company shall calculate the negative number that is the value of a NO<sub>x</sub> emission deficit incurred in that model year using the formula set out in subsection 26(2).
> SOR/2006-268, s. 7.




**29** 

- **(1)** A company shall offset a NOx emission deficit no later than the date on which the company submits the end of model year report under section 32 for the third model year after the model year in which the deficit was incurred.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), a company may offset a NOx emission deficit with an equivalent number of NOx emission credits obtained in accordance with section 26 or obtained from another company.

- **(3)** If any part of a NOx emission deficit for a specific model year is outstanding following the submission of the end of model year report for the second model year after the model year in which the deficit was incurred, the number of NOx emission credits required to offset that outstanding deficit in the next model year is 120% of the deficit.



**30** 

- **(1)** A company that purchases another company or that results from the merger of companies is responsible for offsetting, in accordance with section 29, any outstanding NOx emission deficits of the purchased or merged companies.

- **(2)** In the case of a company that ceases to manufacture, import or sell light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles, the company shall, no later than three calendar years after submitting its last end of model year report, offset all NOx emission deficits that are outstanding at the time that it ceases those activities.
