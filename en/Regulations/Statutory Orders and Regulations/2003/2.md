- **(3)** If any part of a NOx emission deficit for a specific model year is outstanding following the submission of the end of model year report for the second model year after the model year in which the deficit was incurred, the number of NOx emission credits required to offset that outstanding deficit in the next model year is 120% of the deficit.



**30** 

- **(1)** A company that purchases another company or that results from the merger of companies is responsible for offsetting, in accordance with section 29, any outstanding NOx emission deficits of the purchased or merged companies.
