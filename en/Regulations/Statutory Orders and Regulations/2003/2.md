- **(5)** A company may only replace a NOx emission standard as described in subsection (4) if the vehicle complies with any standards that may be applicable at the intermediate useful life.

- **(6)** In respect of the 2004 and 2005 model years, a company may multiply by 2 the number of vehicles that conform to full useful life emission bin 1, and multiply by 1.5 the number of vehicles that conform to full useful life emission bin 2, when calculating one of the following:
	- **(a)** the denominator in subsection (1); or
	- **(b)** “total number of vehicles in the fleet” in the equation for calculating credits in subsection 26(2).

### Calculation of Subfleet Average Emission Values


**32.3** 

- **(1)** If a company’s subfleet includes one or more motorcycles that conform to a family emission limit that is greater than the applicable HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission standard set out in the section of the CFR that is referred to in paragraph 17(a) or subsection 17.1(2), the company shall calculate the average HC+NO<sub>x</sub> value for the subfleet using the following formula:
```
[Σ (A x B x C)] / [Σ (B x C)]
```
where
- **A** is the applicable family emission limit, expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard it replaced;
- **B** is the useful life of the engine family expressed in years or kilometres; and
- **C** is the number of motorcycles in the engine family.

- **(2)** If a company’s subfleet includes one or more motorcycles that conform to a family emission limit that is greater than the fuel tank permeation emission standard set out in the section of the CFR that is referred to in paragraph 17(a), the company shall calculate the average fuel tank permeation value for its subfleet in accordance with the following formula:
```
[Σ (A x B x C x 365.24)] / [Σ (B x C x 365.24)]
```
where
- **A** is the applicable family emission limit, expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard it replaced;
- **B** is the useful life of the engine family expressed in years; and
- **C** is the number of motorcycles in the engine family multiplied by the average internal surface area of the motorcycles’ fuel tanks, where the average internal surface area is expressed in m<sup>2</sup> to at least three decimal places.

- **(3)** The average HC+NO<sub>x</sub> value and average fuel tank permeation value for a subfleet shall be expressed in g/km and g/m²/d, respectively, and be rounded to one decimal place.

- **(4)** When calculating the average HC+NO<sub>x</sub> value for a subfleet of the 2006 model year, a company may include all of its motorcycles of that model year, including those whose main assembly was completed before November 2, 2006.

### Emission Credits for Class III Motorcycles


**32.4** 

- **(1)** A company shall obtain HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission credits in relation to a specific model year if

	- **(b)** the company reports the credits in its end of model year report.

- **(2)** The HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission credits, expressed in units of vehicle-grams, shall be calculated using the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole number:
```
(A - B) x C x D
```
where
- **A** is the applicable HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission standard for the subfleet;
- **B** is the average HC+NO<sub>x</sub> value for the subfleet;
- **C** is the total number of motorcycles in the subfleet; and
- **D** is the useful life expressed in kilometres.

- **(3)** The HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission credits for a specific model year are credited on the last day of that model year and may only be used by a company to offset an HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission deficit that it incurred in the same model year as calculated in section 32.5.
> SOR/2006-268, s. 9.





### Emission Deficits for Class I and Class II Motorcycles


**32.5** 

- **(1)** If a company’s average HC+NO<sub>x</sub> value in respect of a subfleet of Class I and Class II motorcycles of a model year is higher than the applicable HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission standard, the company shall calculate the value of the emission deficit it incurred in that model year.

- **(2)** The HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission deficit for a subfleet of Class I and Class II motorcycles of a model year is the sum of the credits or deficits that would be generated for each class of motorcycle within the subfleet calculated using the formula set out in subsection 32.4(2), with any necessary modifications.
> SOR/2006-268, s. 9.




**32.6** 

- **(1)** A company shall offset an HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission deficit in the model year in which the deficit was incurred, no later than the day on which the company submits its end of model year report.

- **(2)** A company shall offset an HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission deficit with an equivalent number of HC+NO<sub>x</sub> emission credits obtained in the same model year in accordance with section 32.4.
