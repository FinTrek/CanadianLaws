## Interpretation of Standards


**13.1** 

- **(1)** For greater certainty, the standards in these Regulations that refer to the CFR include all of the test procedures, fuels and calculation methods specified for those standards in CFR 90, CFR 1051, CFR 1054 or CFR 1060, as the case may be.

- **(2)** In the case of a standard set out in the CFR that is to be phased in over a period of time for a class of engine, or fuel line or fuel tank attached to an engine, the standard comes into effect, for the purposes of these Regulations, in the model year for which the CFR specifies that the standard applies to 100% of that class of engine, or fuel line or fuel tank attached to an engine and continues to apply until another standard that applies comes into effect.
