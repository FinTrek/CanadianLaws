## Interpretation


**1** The definitions in this section apply in these Regulations.

***refrigerated condenser*** means a closed tetrachloroethylene vapour recovery system that uses mechanical refrigeration to cool the tetrachloroethylene vapour to a liquid for re-use in a dry-cleaning machine. (*condenseur réfrigéré*)

***residue*** means any solid, liquid or sludge waste containing tetrachloroethylene, other than waste water, that is produced at a dry-cleaning facility. (*résidus*)

***spotting agent*** means a substance or mixture of substances that is applied directly to a stain for its removal from textile and apparel goods, rugs, furs, leathers and other similar articles. (*agent détachant*)

***waste management facility*** means a facility that is authorized under applicable laws to handle, recycle or dispose of tetrachloroethylene, waste water and residue. (*installation de gestion des déchets*)

***waste water*** means waste water containing tetrachloroethylene, that is produced by a dry-cleaning machine or during the regeneration of a carbon adsorber. (*eaux résiduaires*)
