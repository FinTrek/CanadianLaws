## Application


**2** These Regulations do not apply in respect of
- **(a)** the dry cleaning of textile and apparel goods, rugs, furs, leathers and other similar articles, except in the course of their manufacture; and
- **(b)** the use of a continuous scouring machine in a textile mill.




## Prohibition


**3** 

- **(1)** No person shall, in a given year, use a solvent set out in column 1 of Schedule 1 in a degreasing process set out in column 2 in a quantity that exceeds the threshold set out in column 3 on or after the date set out in column 4 unless, for each kilogram of solvent that exceeds the threshold, the person has a consumption unit issued by the Minister under subsection 4(1) or transferred under section 6.

- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), in a determination of the quantity of a solvent used in a degreaser, only the amount of solvent that is added to the equipment shall be considered used.

- **(3)** In a determination of the quantity of a solvent used in a degreasing process, the amount of the solvent that has been reclaimed or recycled on site and reused at that site by the person in the same degreasing process shall not be counted.




## Issuance of Consumption Units


**4** 

- **(1)** The Minister shall, on request, issue consumption units to a person for a given solvent and a specific degreasing process for the year beginning on the date set out in column 4 of Schedule 1 or for any subsequent year, if the following conditions are met:
	- **(a)** the person has used the solvent in that process in the year immediately preceding that date;
	- **(b)** the request was submitted to the Minister before October 1 of the year preceding that date;
	- **(c)** the request is made on a form provided by the Minister and contains the information specified in Schedule 2 for each of the years relied on to establish the person’s average annual consumption under subsection (4);
	- **(d)** at the time of submitting the request, the person had documentary evidence to support the information referred to in paragraph (c); and
	- **(e)** the person has been informed in writing by the Minister of their average annual consumption.

- **(2)** The person’s consumption units for a year are equal to the person’s average annual consumption determined in accordance with subsection (4), multiplied by the percentage set out in column 4 of Schedule 3, less the threshold set out in column 3 of Schedule 1, less any consumption unit retired under section 5.

- **(3)** If the calculation in subsection (2) results in a number that
	- **(a)** is zero or less than zero, no consumption units are issued to the person; or
	- **(b)** is not a whole number, the units are rounded to the nearest whole number or, if the result is equidistant from two whole numbers, to the higher of them.

- **(4)** A person’s average annual consumption in respect of a solvent used in a specific degreasing process is established as follows:
	- **(a)** if the person used the solvent in that process in the last year of the period set out column 5 of Schedule 1 but not in the preceding year, the average annual consumption is the quantity of the solvent used by the person during that year;
	- **(b)** if the person used the solvent in that process in the last two years of the period set out in column 5 of Schedule 1 but not in the year prior to those two years, the annual consumption is the average quantity of the solvent used by the person during each of those two years;
	- **(c)** if the person used the solvent in that process in the last three years of the period set out in column 5 of Schedule 1 but not in the year prior to those three years, the annual consumption is the average quantity of the solvent used by the person during each of those three years; and
	- **(d)** if the person used the solvent in that process in earlier years of the period set out in column 5 of Schedule 1, in addition to the last three years of that period, the annual consumption is the average quantity of the solvent used by the person during each of three consecutive years that the person chooses from that period and identifies in the request.

- **(5)** Following a person’s request, the Minister shall inform the person in writing, of their average annual consumption.

- **(6)** The Minister shall inform the person in writing of the number of consumption units issued to that person before the beginning of the year for which the Minister issues the units.

- **(7)** Consumption units are valid only for the year for which they are issued.
> SOR/2011-301, s. 1(F).





## Retirement of Consumption Units


**5** 

- **(1)** If a person wishes to retire a consumption unit, the person shall submit to the Minister the information specified in Schedule 4 on a form provided by the Minister.

- **(2)** A consumption unit that is retired shall not be reissued.




## Transfer of Consumption Units


**6** 

- **(1)** A person may transfer unexpended consumption units to another person for use in the same year and in the same degreasing process for which the consumption units were issued.

- **(2)** A person shall not transfer consumption units until they have been informed in writing that the Minister allows the transfer under subsection (4).

- **(3)** The transferor and transferee shall jointly apply for the transfer of consumption units and shall submit to the Minister the information specified in Schedule 5 on a form provided by the Minister.

- **(4)** The Minister shall allow a transfer, and shall so inform the transferor and transferee in writing, if
	- **(a)** the transferor has an unexpended consumption unit for each consumption unit of the proposed transfer; and
	- **(b)** the transferee undertakes to use each transferred consumption unit in the same year and in the same degreasing process for which the transferor’s consumption unit was issued.

- **(5)** If the Minister discovers that the transferor did not have the unexpended consumption unit referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or that the transferee breached the undertaking referred to in paragraph (4)(b), the Minister shall cancel the transfer and transfer back to the transferor the consumption units unused by the transferee.




## Reporting and Record Keeping — Consumption


**7** Every person who has a consumption unit shall
- **(a)** submit a report to the Minister containing the information specified in Schedule 6 on a form provided by the Minister, no later than 30 days after the end of the year to which the consumption unit applies; and
- **(b)** keep a copy of the report and any documents, including shipping records, supporting the information provided to the Minister or showing quantities of solvent purchased, returned or transferred, or sent to a waste management facility, at the location where the solvent is being used, for a period of five years after the end of the year in respect of which the report is made.




## Reporting and Record Keeping — Sales of Solvent


**8** Every person who sells a solvent for use in degreasing shall
- **(a)** submit a report containing the information specified in Schedule 7 to the Minister on a form provided by the Minister, no later than 30 days after the end of the year in which the sale occurs; and
- **(b)** keep a copy of the report and any documents, including shipping records, supporting the information provided to the Minister or showing quantities of solvent purchased, returned or transferred, or sent to a waste management facility, at the seller’s principal place of business in Canada, for a period of five years after the year of the sale.

## Refusal or Cancellation


**10** 

- **(1)** The Minister may refuse to issue a consumption unit or may cancel a consumption unit if the person requesting it or the user, as the case may be, has submitted any false or misleading information.

- **(2)** The Minister shall not refuse to issue, or shall not cancel, a consumption unit unless the Minister
	- **(a)** has provided the person requesting the issuance or the user, as the case may be, with written reasons for refusing to issue the consumption unit or for cancelling it; and
