## Opening of Retail Deposit Accounts



**Definition of point of service**

**2** 

- **(1)** For the purpose of subsection 448.1(1) of the Act, ***point of service*** means a physical location to which the public has access and at which a member bank carries on business with the public and opens or initiates the opening of retail deposit accounts through natural persons in Canada.

- **(2)** Every point of service is a prescribed point of service for the purpose of subsection 448.1(1) of the Act.
> SOR/2009-49, s. 1.





**Refusal to open account**

**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), subsection 448.1(1) of the Act does not apply in the following circumstances:
	- **(a)** if the member bank has reasonable grounds to believe that the retail deposit account will be used for illegal or fraudulent purposes;
	- **(b)** if the individual has a history of illegal or fraudulent activity in relation to providers of financial services and if the most recent instance of such activity occurred less than seven years before the day on which the request to open a retail deposit account is made;
	- **(c)** if the member bank has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual, for the purpose of opening the retail deposit account, knowingly made a material misrepresentation in the information provided to the member bank;
	- **(d)** if the member bank has reasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary to refuse to open the retail deposit account in order to protect the customers or employees of the member bank from physical harm, harassment or other abuse; or
	- **(e)** if the request is made at a branch or point of service of a member bank at which the only retail deposit accounts offered are those that are linked to an account at another financial institution.

**Bankruptcy**

- **(2)** For greater certainty and for the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), the fact that the individual is or has been a bankrupt does not, by itself without any evidence of fraud or any other illegal activity in relation to the bankruptcy, constitute reasonable grounds for a member bank to believe that an account for the individual will be used for illegal or fraudulent purposes.

**Location**

- **(3)** If an individual requests the opening of a retail deposit account at a point of service at which the opening of such an account can only be initiated, the member bank is not required to open the account at that physical location; however, the bank shall, subject to these Regulations, open the account at another physical location.

- **(2)** If the member bank, based on its verification of the circumstances set out in paragraphs 3(1)(a) to (d) or the pieces of identification, or based on information, if any, provided by the individual that is related to the request, has reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is misrepresenting their identity, the individual shall present to the member bank one piece of identification from among those set out in Part A of the schedule that bears the individual’s photograph and signature.
