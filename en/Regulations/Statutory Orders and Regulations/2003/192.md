Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources, pursuant to subsection 5(1) of the Canada–Newfoundland Atlantic Accord Implementation Act<sup><a href='#fn_SOR-2003-192_e_hq_5782'>[a]</a></sup>, hereby makes the annexed Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Line Regulations.




## Offshore Area Adjacent to that of the Province of Nova Scotia


**1** For the purposes of paragraph (a) of the definition ***offshore area*** in section 2 of the Canada–Newfoundland Atlantic Accord Implementation Act, the prescribed line of the offshore area of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador that is adjacent to the offshore area of the province of Nova Scotia, as defined in section 2 of the [Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1988/c.%2028.md), is the line described in the schedule.




## Coming into Force


**2** These Regulations come into force on the day on which they are registered.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Section 1)**
## Offshore Area Adjacent to that of the Province of Nova Scotia
(All latitudes and longitudes are determined according to NAD 83)


As delimited in the award of the arbitration tribunal in conclusion of the second phase of arbitration between the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia on March 26, 2002, the line of the offshore area of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador that is adjacent to the offshore area of the province of Nova Scotia, as defined in section 2 of the [Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1988/c.%2028.md), is the following:

commencing at a point at 47°45′41.8″ north latitude and 60°24′12.5″ west longitude the line continues



southeasterly along a geodesic line to a point at 47°25′31.7″ north latitude and 59°43′37.1″ west longitude;



thence southeasterly along a geodesic line to a point at 46°54′48.9″ north latitude and 59°00′34.9″ west longitude;



thence southeasterly along a geodesic line to a point at 46°22′51.7″ north latitude and 58°01′20.0″ west longitude;



thence southeasterly along the following geodesic lines, but only as far as the point of intersection between one of those lines and the outer edge of the continental margin as determined by international law:



along a geodesic line from the previous point to a point at 46°17′25.1″ north latitude and 57°53′52.7″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 46°07′57.7″ north latitude and 57°44′05.1″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 45°41′31.4″ north latitude and 57°31′33.5″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 44°55′51.9″ north latitude and 57°10′34.0″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 43°14′13.9″ north latitude and 56°23′55.7″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 42°56′48.5″ north latitude and 56°16′52.1″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 42°03′46.3″ north latitude and 55°54′58.1″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 41°45′00.8″ north latitude and 55°47′31.6″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 41°42′24.7″ north latitude and 55°46′23.8″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 41°06′19.2″ north latitude and 55°36′10.9″ west longitude,



thence along a geodesic line to a point at 40°58′21.7″ north latitude and 55°34′23.3″ west longitude, and



thence along a geodesic line having an azimuth of 166°19′50″.
