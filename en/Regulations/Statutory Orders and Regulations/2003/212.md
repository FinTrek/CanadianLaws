### Initial Application


**7** 

- **(1)** In the case of an initial application for a facility or activity for which an estimated annual fee has not been calculated, the applicant shall pay to the Commission, with the application, a deposit of
	- **(a)** $25,000, if the application is in respect of a facility; or
	- **(b)** $5,000, if the application is in respect of a waste nuclear substance activity.

- **(2)** On receipt of the application and deposit, the Commission shall calculate the estimated annual fee payable for the current fiscal year in accordance with paragraph 4(a).

- **(3)** On a quarterly basis over the remaining quarters of the fiscal year after receipt of the application, the Commission shall invoice the applicant for the amount of the estimated annual fee payable, which is calculated on the basis of the number of quarters remaining in the fiscal year and is reduced by the amount of the deposit.

	- **(d)** an hourly rate as described in section 14.




### Base Hours


**11** For each type of application or licence, the base hours are the number of hours spent by the Commission
