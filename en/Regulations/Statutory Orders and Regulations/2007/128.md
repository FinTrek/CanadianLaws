- **(4)** If the carbon monoxide level in a cargo space increases steadily or exceeds 50 ppm, the master of a self-unloading vessel that loads or unloads coal at a Canadian port before, during or after an inland voyage may meet the requirements of subsection (5) instead of
	- **(a)** ensuring that the cargo space is completely closed down and all ventilation ceased;
	- **(b)** seeking expert advice immediately; and
	- **(c)** notifying the vessel’s owners.

- **(5)** The requirements referred to in subsection (4) are the following:
	- **(a)** to ensure that readings of the carbon monoxide level and the lower explosion limit are taken at least every 4 hours in the first 24 hours of sailing and after that at least
		- **(i)** once per day if the carbon monoxide levels are less than 50 ppm,
		- **(ii)** twice per day if the carbon monoxide levels are 50 ppm or more but less than 500 ppm, and
		- **(iii)** once every 4 hours if the carbon monoxide levels are 500 ppm or more; and
	- **(b)** to notify the vessel’s owners and the Department of Transport Marine Safety Office nearest to the vessel if both the carbon monoxide level and the lower explosion limit are simultaneously increasing.

## Load Moment Indicator Systems
**1** A load moment indicator system installed on a category 4 lifting appliance shall
- **(a)** use the same type of measuring units that the load radius chart uses;
- **(b)** clearly indicate the measuring units used;
- **(c)** give a clear and precise indication of
	- **(i)** the lifting capacity of the appliance,
	- **(ii)** the total weight suspended,
	- **(iii)** the elevated angle of the boom, and
	- **(iv)** the radius of the boom;
- **(d)** be clearly visible so that an operator seated at the control position can easily read the indications during both day and night conditions;
- **(e)** be resistant to magnetic influence, weather, shock and vibration;
- **(f)** have a visual system that
	- **(i)** warns the operator when 85% of the appliance’s SWL has been reached, and
	- **(ii)** does not create an operational hazard; and
- **(g)** have a visual and audible system in the interior of the cab and an exterior audible system that
	- **(i)** warns the operator when 98% of the appliance’s SWL has been reached,
	- **(ii)** does not create an operational hazard, and
	- **(iii)** in the case of the audible signal, is identifiable by the operator despite ambient and machinery noise.


**2** A load moment indicator system that is installed on a category 4 lifting appliance on a Canadian vessel that is not a restricted vessel shall
- **(a)** give a clear and precise indication of the angles of heel and trim and of the reduced lifting capacity for those angles;
- **(b)** be clearly visible so that an operator seated at the control position can easily read the indication during both day and night conditions;
- **(c)** have an automatic emergency braking system that prevents freefall of the load without jolting in the event of overload; and
- **(d)** have a manual control to bypass the automatic emergency braking system that is accessible to an operator seated at the control position and is protected against accidental operation.
