**All proposed undertakings to be considered**

**10** If a project concerns an installation used for oil or gas exploration or exploitation, the environmental assessment shall be conducted for any construction, operation, modification, decommissioning, abandonment or other undertaking during the life-cycle of that installation that is proposed by the proponent as well as any construction, operation, modification, decommissioning, abandonment or other undertaking during the life-cycle of that installation that, in the opinion of the decision-making authority or, if the project is referred to a mediator or a review panel, of the council of the first nation, is likely to be carried out in relation to that installation.




**Factors that must be considered**

**11** 

- **(1)** Each environmental assessment of a project shall consider the following factors:
	- **(a)** the environmental effects of the project, including the environmental effects of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the project, and any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the project in combination with other projects or activities that have been or will be undertaken;
