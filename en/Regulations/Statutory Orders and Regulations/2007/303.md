#### Gross Expenditure Base



##### Population Adjusted Gross Expenditure Escalator



###### Calculation Accuracy


**22** Every calculation used to determine the population adjusted gross expenditure escalator shall be made to five decimal places.




###### Population Adjustment Factor


**23** 

- **(1)** The population adjustment factor, defined in subsection 4(1) of the Act, for the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made is more particularly defined to be equal to the ratio
```
1 + A : 1 + B
```
where
- **A** is the three-year moving average of the rate of change of the population of the territory; and
- **B** is the three-year moving average of the rate of change of the population of Canada.

- **(2)** For the purpose of subsection (1), the three-year moving average is determined by the formula
```
[(P4/P5 - 1) + (P3/P4 - 1) + (P2/P3 - 1)] /3
```
where
- **P2** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, two fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;
- **P3** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;
- **P4** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, four fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made; and
- **P5** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, five fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made.




###### Provincial Local Government Expenditure Index


**24** 

- **(1)** The provincial local government expenditure index, defined in subsection 4(1) of the Act, is more particularly defined to be the amount determined by the formula
```
1 + {[(P4/P5 - 1) + (P3/P4 - 1) + (P2/P3 - 1)] / 3}
```
where
- **P2** is the amount of the provincial local government expenditures two fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;
- **P3** is the amount of the provincial local government expenditures three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;
- **P4** is the amount of the provincial local government expenditures four fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made; and
- **P5** is the amount of the provincial local government expenditures five fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made.

- **(2)** For the purpose of subsection (1), the provincial local government expenditures for a fiscal year shall be calculated on a non-seasonally adjusted basis and be based on the data from Statistics Canada’s publication entitled National Income and Expenditure Accounts – Quarterly Estimates that is available to the Minister at the time of the calculation referred to in section 4.3 of the Act. The expenditures shall be equal to the sum of
	- **(a)** the expenses of the provincial and territorial general government sector, as determined by the formula
```
A - B - C - D + E
```
where
- **A** is the gross outlay,
- **B** is the total of net capital transfers,
- **C** is the total of transfers to local governments,
- **D** is the total of capital consumption allowances, and
- **E** is the total investment in fixed capital, and
	- **(b)** the expenses of the local general government sector, as determined by the formula
```
F - G - H - I + J
```
where
- **F** is the gross outlay,
- **G** is the total of net capital transfers,
- **H** is the total of transfers to provincial and territorial governments,
- **I** is the total of capital consumption allowances, and
- **J** is the total investment in fixed capital.
> SOR/2013-225, s. 23.





##### Adjustment


**25** 

- **(1)** If, following the conclusion of a personal income tax room sharing agreement between the Government of Yukon and a specified Yukon aboriginal government, the Minister determines, under subparagraph 4.2(a)(iii) of the Act, that the gross expenditure base of Yukon is to be adjusted by the amount determined by the following formula, the adjustment shall be applied on a non-cumulative basis for each of the second, third and fourth fiscal years following that in which the agreement was concluded:
```
A - (70% × B)
```
where
- **A** is equal to the amount of tax, determined in accordance with the agreement, that is foregone by the Government of Yukon for the taxation year that is two years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment for Yukon is being calculated, and
- **B** is the average difference — for the taxation years that are two, three and four years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment for Yukon is being calculated — between the yield for Yukon revenues derived from personal income, net of federal and Yukon territorial personal income tax assessed in respect of Yukon residents, when it is calculated
- **(a)** without taking into account the specified Yukon aboriginal government’s federal tax abatement and territorial tax credit, and
- **(b)** taking into account that abatement and that credit.

- **(2)** Only the adjustment made in the fourth fiscal year is subject to escalation under the population adjusted gross expenditure escalator.
> SOR/2009-327, s. 7.





##### Recalculation


**26** For the purpose of recalculating the gross expenditure base under subsection 4(2) of the Act, the prescribed information is the population information set out in the certificate in accordance with paragraph 28(3)(b), but it does not include the information for a fiscal year prior to fiscal year 2003–2004.
