	- **(b)** calculating a weight for the personal income tax system of each of the 10 provinces equal to a fraction
		- **(i)** whose numerator is the revenue for the fiscal year, as set out in the certificate, from the taxes described in subparagraph 4(1)(a)(i) or paragraph 7(1)(a), as the case may be, that is derived by the province with the personal income tax system for which the weight is being calculated, and

#### Gross Expenditure Base



##### Population Adjusted Gross Expenditure Escalator



###### Calculation Accuracy


**22** Every calculation used to determine the population adjusted gross expenditure escalator shall be made to five decimal places.




###### Population Adjustment Factor


**23** 

- **(1)** The population adjustment factor, defined in subsection 4(1) of the Act, for the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made is more particularly defined to be equal to the ratio
```
1 + A : 1 + B
```

- **B** is the three-year moving average of the rate of change of the population of Canada.

- **(2)** For the purpose of subsection (1), the three-year moving average is determined by the formula
```
[(P4/P5 - 1) + (P3/P4 - 1) + (P2/P3 - 1)] /3
```
where
- **P2** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, two fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;
- **P3** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;
- **P4** is the population of the territory or Canada, as the case may be, four fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made; and

###### Provincial Local Government Expenditure Index


**24** 

- **(1)** The provincial local government expenditure index, defined in subsection 4(1) of the Act, is more particularly defined to be the amount determined by the formula
```
1 + {[(P4/P5 - 1) + (P3/P4 - 1) + (P2/P3 - 1)] / 3}
```
where
- **P2** is the amount of the provincial local government expenditures two fiscal years prior to the fiscal year for which the territorial formula financing payment may be made;

```
A - (70% × B)
```
where
- **A** is equal to the remittances, made by the Government of Canada to the Kwanlin Dun First Nation under the agreement, for the taxation year in which the agreement was concluded, and
- **B** is the difference between the measured yield for Yukon revenues derived from personal income, net of federal and Yukon territorial personal income tax assessed in respect of Yukon residents for the fiscal year in which the agreement was concluded, when it is
- **(a)** calculated without taking into account the Yukon First Nation federal tax abatement and the Yukon First Nation territorial tax credit for the Kwanlin Dun First Nation, and
- **(b)** calculated taking into account those abatements and credits.

- **(2)** Only the adjustment made in the fourth fiscal year is subject to escalation under the population adjusted gross expenditure escalator.

- **(3)** In the case where the Minister has made an estimate under paragraph (2)(b) of a revenue base referred to in any of paragraphs 19(1)(a), (c), (d) or (f), the revenue base shall be replaced by the product of the estimate and a fraction
	- **(a)** whose numerator is one plus a fraction whose numerator is the territory’s percentage of the population of all 10 provinces and the three territories for the fiscal year and whose denominator is that percentage for the prior fiscal year for which information for the revenue base is set out in the certificate; and
	- **(b)** whose denominator is two.

- **(4)** If, in accordance with paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3), a revenue base for a fiscal year is estimated or replaced on the basis of information from an earlier fiscal year, the Minister may adjust that revenue base to take into account economic factors or trends that could change the territorial share of that revenue base between that earlier fiscal year and the fiscal year.

- **(5)** If any of the information that is required to calculate a revenue base for a fiscal year is missing from the certificate and the Minister is unable to estimate or replace the revenue base in accordance with paragraph (2)(b) or subsection (3), the Minister shall, after consulting with Statistics Canada, estimate that revenue base on the basis of any information that is available to the Minister.

**36** 

- **(1)** The Minister may, after receiving from a province a completed application referred to in section 32 or 35 for a fiscal year, make one or more estimates of any amount that may become payable to that province in respect of fiscal stabilization for that fiscal year.

- **(2)** If the Minister estimates that a fiscal stabilization payment is to be paid to the province , the Minister may make one or more advance payments to the province on account of that payment, but the cumulative total of those advances shall not be more than the limit referred to in subsection 6(8) of the Act.



**37** 

- **(1)** An amount lent to a province under subsection 6(9) of the Act is repayable or recoverable in 60 equal monthly instalments, the first of which becomes due and payable 30 days after the day on which the amount is lent.

- **(2)** If the amount of the final computation of the fiscal stabilization payment to be paid is more than the total amount of advance payments made under subsection 36(2), the Minister shall, subject to the limit set out in subsection 6(8) of the Act, pay the difference between those amounts to the province.



**39** Subject to sections 37 and 41, the Minister may, in whole or in part, deduct the amount of an overpayment made in relation to a fiscal stabilization payment made to a province from any amount that is payable to that province under the Act.

Any amount of that difference that is not deducted may be recovered from the province as a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

- **(2)** An amount that is repaid by, or recovered from, the province under section 37 before the deduction or recovery referred to in subsection (1) reduces the balance that would otherwise have been determined to be outstanding on a loan to a province made under subsection 6(9) of the Act.

- **(3)** On making a deduction or recovery referred to in subsection (1), each monthly instalment that otherwise would be due and payable under section 37 is reduced to the quotient that results from dividing the difference between the balance referred to in subsection (2) and the amount of the deduction or recovery by the number of instalments remaining to be paid.

**41** 

- **(1)** The Minister shall, for each province in relation to each fiscal year in the period beginning on April 1, 2007 and ending on March 31, 2014, calculate the net aggregate of overpayments to be recovered from that province by determining

	- **(b)** for a fiscal year within the period beginning on April 1, 2009 and ending on March 31, 2014, $140 per capita.

- **(3)** If, after subtracting the amount recovered from the province in the fiscal year in respect of the net aggregate of overpayments, there remains an outstanding balance for the net aggregate of overpayments, that balance shall be deferred until the following fiscal year and be taken into account when calculating that year’s net aggregate of overpayments for the province.

- **(4)** Despite subsection (2), if any portion of the deferred outstanding balance remains outstanding at the end of the second fiscal year following that in which payment was first made by the province, that balance shall be recovered during the fiscal year that immediately follows that second fiscal year and, for greater certainty, that balance shall not be taken into account when calculating the net aggregate of overpayments for that immediately following fiscal year.



**42** The prescribed amounts referred to in section 3.95 of the Act are equal monthly amounts required to repay the payment referred to in that section over the period beginning on April 1, 2007 and ending on March 31, 2016.
