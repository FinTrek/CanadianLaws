**Revolving mortgages**

**30** A registered mortgage has priority over a subsequently registered interest that affects the same parcel of Westbank land, to the extent of the money actually advanced under the mortgage, to a maximum of the amount secured by the mortgage, even if all or part of the money was advanced after the registration of the subsequently registered interest, unless the mortgagee had actual notice of the registration of the subsequently registered interest before making the advance.




**Deferred priority**

**31** 

- **(1)** The holder of a registered interest, or a person applying to register an interest, may apply to record a postponement agreement that gives priority over the registered interest to a specified interest that was, or is to be, subsequently registered.
