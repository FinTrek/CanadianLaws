## Interpretation



**Definition of Act**

**1** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations, ***Act*** means the [Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/2006/c.%2013.md).

**Other definitions**

- **(2)** The expressions ***American softwood lumber exports***, ***American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada*** and ***Canadian softwood lumber exports*** have the same meaning as in paragraph 1 of Annex 7D of the softwood lumber agreement, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the [Export and Import Permits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-19.md), as those expressions are, from time to time, amended by the parties or clarified as a result of an arbitral award.




**Data sources**

**2** The source of data to be used for calculations under these Regulations is
- **(a)** Statistics Canada, for Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States;
- **(b)** the United States Census Bureau, for American softwood lumber exports and American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada; and
- **(c)** the Western Wood Products Association’s monthly publication “Lumber Track”, for American shipments of softwood lumber.




**American consumption**

**3** American consumption of softwood lumber is the amount determined by the formula
```
CE + AI + NAS
```
where
- **CE** is Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States;
- **AI** is American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada; and
- **NAS** is net American shipments of softwood lumber.




**Net American shipments**

**4** Net American shipments of softwood lumber are the amount determined by the formula
```
AS - AE
```
where
- **AS** is American shipments of softwood lumber calculated as the sum of the softwood lumber shipments from the Western (Coast, Inland and California Redwood) region, the Southern region and the Northern region. Northern region shipments are calculated by taking the sum of Western and Southern region shipments and multiplying by 6.25%; and
- **AE** is American softwood lumber exports from those regions.




## Expected Monthly American Consumption



**Expected monthly American consumption**

**5** For the purposes of subsections 14(3) and (4) of the Act, the expected monthly American consumption of softwood lumber products is the amount determined by the formula
```
(AC/12) × SAF
```
where
- **AC** is American consumption of softwood lumber for the 12–month period ending 3 months immediately before the month for which the expected monthly American consumption is being calculated; and
- **SAF** is the seasonal adjustment factor for the pertinent month set out in the schedule.




## Market Share



**American consumption of non-Canadian imports**

**6** For the purposes of paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Act, the share of American consumption of softwood lumber products from imports not originating in Canada is the amount determined by the formula
```
AI/AC
```
where
- **AI** is American softwood lumber imports from countries other than Canada; and
- **AC** is American consumption of softwood lumber.




**American consumption of Canadian exports**

**7** For the purposes of paragraph 40(1)(b) of the Act, the Canadian market share of American consumption of softwood lumber products is the amount determined by the formula
```
CE/AC
```
where
- **CE** is Canadian softwood lumber exports to the United States; and
- **AC** is American consumption of softwood lumber.




**American consumption of net American shipments**

**8** For the purposes of paragraph 40(1)(c) of the Act, the American market share of American consumption of softwood lumber products is the amount determined by the formula
```
NAS/AC
```
where
- **NAS** is net American shipments of softwood lumber; and
- **AC** is American consumption of softwood lumber.
