The airport reference point shown on Churchill Airport Zoning Plan No. E2244 dated October 23, 1986, is a point being the mid point on a line drawn between the mid points of runways 07-25 and 15-33 with 6° U.T.M. grid coordinates of Northing 6 511 764.202 m and Easting 438 254.808 m.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Churchill Airport Zoning Plan No. E2244 dated October 23, 1986, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 07-25 and 15-33 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 07 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip;



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 25 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip;

Each transitional surface, shown on Churchill Airport Zoning Plan No. E2244 dated October 23, 1986, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surface to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Outer Limits of Lands

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Churchill Airport Zoning Plan No. E2244 dated October 23, 1986, is described as follows:

Commencing at a point in the southeasterly limit of Parcel 1, Plan 5292 Neepawa Land Titles, where it is intersected by the circumference of a circle having a radius of 4 000 m and centered at the airport reference point as described in Part I of the schedule; thence southwesterly along the southeasterly limit of said Parcel 1 to the most southerly corner thereof; thence northwesterly along the southwesterly limit of said Parcel 1 to the most southerly corner of Parcel A, Plan 7597 Neepawa Land Titles; thence northerly along the easterly limits of said Parcel A to the most northerly corner thereof; thence northeasterly along the northwesterly limits of Parcels 3 and 2, Plan 5292, Neepawa Land Titles, to an intersection with the ordinary high water mark of Hudson Bay; thence southeasterly along the ordinary high water mark of Hudson Bay to an intersection with the circumference of a circle having a radius of 4 000 m and centered at the airport reference point as described in Part I of the schedule; thence in a northeasterly direction following the circumference of the said circle clockwise to the point of commencement.
