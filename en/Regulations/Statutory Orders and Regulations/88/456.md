## Criteria for Determining the Validity of a Claim for Exemption


**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), for the purpose of determining whether a claim for exemption from disclosing information in accordance with section 11 of the Act is valid, a screening officer or an appeal board, as the case may be, shall have regard exclusively to the following criteria:
	- **(a)** whether the information is confidential to the claimant;
	- **(b)** whether the claimant has taken measures that are reasonable in the circumstances to maintain the confidentiality of the information; and
	- **(c)** whether the information has actual or potential economic value to the claimant or to the claimant’s competitors because it is confidential and the disclosure of the information would result in a material financial loss to the claimant or a material financial gain to the claimant’s competitors.

- **(2)** For the purpose of deciding that a claim for exemption from disclosing information in accordance with section 11 of the Act is valid, but not for the purpose of deciding that such a claim for exemption is not valid, a screening officer or an appeal board, as the case may be, shall, as a criterion, have regard to whether the money expended and the other business resources employed by the claimant to develop the information are substantial in the circumstances.

- **(3)** For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), information does not cease to be confidential to the claimant by reason only that it is known to persons who have
	- **(a)** obtained the information in confidence, express or implied, and are obligated by contract or trust, express or implied, or otherwise by law or equity to maintain the confidentiality of the information; or
	- **(b)** possession of the information without colour of right or lawful authority.
