### **SCHEDULE V** 
**(Paragraph 39(c))**
## Method of Testing for Determining Flammable Solids That Ignite Readily

#### Preparation of Samples

**1** For granules, powders and pastes, pack the sample into a flat, rectangular metal boat with inner dimensions 2.54 cm (1 inch) wide, 15.25 cm (6 inches) long and 0.63 cm (0.25 inch) deep.


**2** For rigid and pliable solids, measure the dimensions of the sample and support it by means of metal ringstands, clamps, rings or other suitable devices as needed, so that the major axis is oriented horizontally and the maximum surface is freely exposed to the atmosphere.



#### Procedure

**3** 

- **(1)** Place the prepared sample in a draft-free area that can be ventilated and cleared after each test.

- **(2)** The temperature of the sample at the time of testing shall be between 19.8°C (68°F) and 29.7°C (86°F).

- **(3)** Hold a burning paraffin candle whose diameter is at least 2.54 cm (1 in.), so that the flame is in contact with the surface of the sample at the end of its major axis for five seconds or until the sample ignites, whichever is less, and remove the candle.

- **(4)** Using a stopwatch, determine the length of time of combustion with self-sustained flame (the time not to exceed 60 seconds).

- **(5)** Extinguish the flame with a C0<sub>2</sub> or similar non-destructive-type fire extinguisher.

- **(6)** Measure the dimensions of the burnt area and calculate the rate of burning along the major axis of the sample in centimetres or inches per second.

### **SCHEDULE VI** 
**(Section 40)**
## Test for Determining the Flashback and the Length of the Flame Projection of Products, Materials and Substances Packaged in Aerosol Containers

#### Application

**1** This test is for use in determining any flashback and the length of the flame projection of any product, material or substance packaged in an aerosol container.



#### Apparatus

**2** The following apparatus shall be used in carrying out this test:
- **(a)** a flammability tester, illustrated in the figure, that
	- **(i)** is designed so that the aerosol container can be secured in place by means of a device, such as a three-pronged clamp affixed to a ring stand, in such a manner that the discharge from the container is in the horizontal plane,
	- **(ii)** may include a device by which the valve of any aerosol container can be activated by remote control such as a side-pull, caliper-type bicycle hand brake,
	- **(iii)** has a vertically mounted burner
		- **(A)** that has an inside diameter of 1.2 mm,
		- **(B)** that has been made from a Luer-Lock 16 gauge needle affixed to a metal tube or from other suitable material or devices, and
		- **(C)** that is placed at a distance of 15 cm from the discharge orifice of the aerosol container, such distance to be measured horizontally between the vertical planes of the discharge orifice and the burner orifice, and
	- **(iv)** has two support frameworks
		- **(A)** each having an internal open space 35 cm wide by 45 cm high, constructed from metal or other non-flammable material and mounted in a vertical plane perpendicular to the direction of discharge from the aerosol container, one being at a distance of 15 cm from the burner and the other at a distance of 45 cm from the burner and both being on the opposite side of the burner from the container, and
		- **(B)** that are adjustable in the vertical plane;
- **(b)** an n-butane gas cylinder (C.P. grade) fitted with a regulator capable of delivering pressure to the burner appropriate to maintaining the flame heights specified in subsection 4(5); and
- **(c)** loosely woven cotton fabric commonly referred to as cheesecloth that has, in the bleached state, a mass per unit area of not less than 35 g/m<sup>2</sup> and not more than 65 g/m<sup>2</sup>.



#### Test Specimen

**3** 

- **(1)** Where there are instructions by the manufacturer respecting the shaking of the aerosol container, a test comprised of three discharges from each of three aerosol containers of the same product and of the same size shall be conducted.

- **(2)** Where there are no instructions by the manufacturer respecting the shaking of the aerosol container, a test comprised of three discharges from the container without shaking and subsequently, three discharges from the container after shaking, in accordance with subsection 4(9), from each of three aerosol containers of the same product and of the same size shall be conducted.



#### Procedure

**4** 

- **(1)** A test
	- **(a)** shall be carried out at a temperature of (22 ± 2) °C in the absence of air currents with an allowance made for a clearance of 50 cm beyond the framework set at a distance of 45 cm from the burner; and
	- **(b)** may be conducted in a fume hood with the exhaust fan turned off and the protecting door lowered.

- **(2)** All the fumes shall be exhausted and the residues cleaned up after each discharge.

- **(3)** Each aerosol container shall be conditioned to a temperature of (22 ± 2) °C and a discharge shall be released for five seconds from each aerosol container prior to testing.

- **(4)** Install the first aerosol container in the device and ensure that the burner orifice is 15 cm from the discharge orifice in the horizontal plane and 5 cm below it in the vertical plane and that the discharge orifice points in the direction of the burner.

- **(5)** Adjust the burner to give a flame height of 5 cm and release a trial discharge from the aerosol container and, if no flame projection occurs, lower the burner orifice by 5 cm and adjust the burner to give a flame height of 12 cm.

- **(6)** Attach the cheesecloth to the flammability tester with bulldog clips or in any other manner so as to cover the entire internal space of the support framework set at a distance of 15 cm from the burner.

- **(7)** Verify that the cheesecloth is at a proper horizontal distance from the vertical plane of the burner orifice (on the opposite side of the burner from the aerosol container).

- **(8)** Adjust the height of the framework so that the cheesecloth will intercept the line of flame projection.

- **(9)** Prepare the aerosol container in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and
	- **(a)** if shaking is applicable,
		- **(i)** shake vigorously for five seconds, or for the period of time specified in the manufacturer’s instructions,
		- **(ii)** install the container in the device, and
		- **(iii)** 15 seconds after the cessation of shaking, release the first discharge in accordance with subsection (10); or
	- **(b)** if shaking is not applicable, install the container in the device and release the discharge in accordance with subsection (10).

- **(10)** Release a discharge
	- **(a)** until the valve of the aerosol container has been open for five seconds; or
	- **(b)** where any part of the cheesecloth ignites before the end of five seconds, until the time of such ignition.

- **(11)** For each subsequent discharge of each aerosol container tested, allow the container to stand for at least 60 seconds, and
	- **(a)** if shaking is applicable, repeat the procedure referred to in paragraph (9)(a); or
	- **(b)** if shaking is not applicable, release the discharge in accordance with subsection (10).

- **(12)** Where the cheesecloth mounted on the support framework set at a distance of 15 cm from the burner ignites, the remaining discharges referred to in section 3 shall be carried out in accordance with subsections (1) to (11), but with a new piece of cheesecloth attached to the support framework set at a distance of 45 cm from the burner.



#### Determination and Reporting of Flame Projection and Flashback

**5** 

- **(1)** Where, at any time during the test, the cheesecloth mounted at a distance of 45 cm from the burner in accordance with subsection 4(12) is ignited, the length of the flame projection is 45 cm or more.

- **(2)** Where, at any time during the test, the cheesecloth mounted at a distance of 15 cm from the burner in accordance with subsection 4(6) is ignited but the cheesecloth mounted at a distance of 45 cm from the burner in accordance with subsection 4(12) is not ignited, the length of the flame projection is 15 cm or more but less than 45 cm.

- **(3)** Where, at any time during the test, the cheesecloth mounted at a distance of 15 cm from the burner in accordance with subsection 4(6) is not ignited, but there is a flame projection, the length of the flame projection is less than 15 cm.


**6** The following results shall be reported:
- **(a)** the length of the flame projection;
- **(b)** a lack of flame projection resulting from any of the test discharges; and
- **(c)** any flashback.
