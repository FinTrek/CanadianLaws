### NORMAL VALUE ADJUSTMENTS



#### Quantitative Adjustments


**3** For the purposes of sections 15, l9 and 20 of the Act, the price of like goods shall be adjusted to reflect the quantity discount generally granted in connection with a sale of like goods in the same or substantially the same quantities as the quantities of the goods sold to the importer in Canada.

- **(a)** adding thereto the amount that would reflect the costs that would be incurred by the exporter, or
- **(b)** deducting therefrom the amount that would reflect the savings that would accrue to the exporter,
if the like goods were sold by the exporter in the same or substantially the same quantities as the quantities of goods sold to the importer in Canada.




#### Qualitative Differences


**5** For the purposes of sections 15, 19 and 20 of the Act, where the goods sold to the importer in Canada and the like goods differ

- **(d)** in their conditions of sale, other than the conditions referred to in paragraphs (b) or (c) or any conditions that result in any adjustment being made pursuant to any other section of these Regulations,
and that difference would be reflected in a difference between the price of the like goods and the price at which goods that are identical in all respects, including conditions of sale, to the goods sold to the importer in Canada would be sold in the country of export, the price of the like goods shall be adjusted
- **(e)** where the price of the like goods is greater than the price of the identical goods, by deducting therefrom the estimated difference between those prices; and

#### Discounts


**6** For the purposes of sections 15, 19 and 20 of the Act, where any rebate, deferred discount or discount for cash is generally granted in relation to the sale of like goods in the country of export, the price of the like goods shall be adjusted by deducting therefrom the amount of any such generally granted rebate or discount for which the sale of the goods to the importer in Canada would qualify if that sale occurred in the country of export.




#### Delivery Costs


**7** For the purposes of sections 15 and 19 and subparagraph 20(1)(c)(i) of the Act, where like goods are sold at a delivered price, the price of the like goods shall be adjusted by deducting therefrom the cost of their delivery.

- **(a)** the amount of any costs, charges or expenses incurred by the vendor of the like goods in selling to purchasers who are at the trade level nearest and subsequent to that of the importer that result from activities that would not be performed if the like goods were sold to purchasers who are at the same or substantially the same trade level as that of the importer; or
- **(b)** in the absence of information relating to the costs, charges and expenses mentioned in paragraph (a), an amount not exceeding the discount that is generally granted on the sale of like goods by other vendors in the country of export to purchasers who are at the same or substantially the same trade level as the importer.

		- **(ii)** depressed the price of like goods, or
		- **(iii)** suppressed the price of like goods by preventing the price increases for those like goods that would otherwise likely have occurred;

	- **(a)** the nature of the subsidy in question and the effects it is likely to have on trade;
	- **(b)** whether there has been a significant rate of increase of dumped or subsidized goods imported into Canada, which rate of increase indicates a likelihood of substantially increased imports into Canada of the dumped or subsidized goods;
	- **(c)** whether there is sufficient freely disposable capacity, or an imminent, substantial increase in the capacity of an exporter, that indicates a likelihood of a substantial increase of dumped or subsidized goods, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any increase;

		- **(i)** the volumes and prices of imports of like goods that are not dumped or subsidized,
		- **(ii)** a contraction in demand for the goods or like goods,
		- **(iii)** any change in the pattern of consumption of the goods or like goods,
		- **(iv)** trade-restrictive practices of, and competition between, foreign and domestic producers,

**37.11** For the purposes of determining whether injury has been caused by a massive importation of dumped or subsidized goods, or by a series of importations of dumped or subsidized goods where the importations have occurred within a relatively short period of time and in the aggregate are massive, the following factors are prescribed:
- **(a)** whether there has been an increase of at least 15% in the volume of imports of those goods from an individual country of export and in respect of which an investigation under the Act has not been terminated, during a representative period within the period beginning 90 days before the date of initiation of the investigation and ending on the date of the Commissioner’s preliminary determination under subsection 38(1) of the Act, relative to a preceding representative period of comparable duration within the period of investigation;
- **(b)** whether the importer, producer or exporter of the dumped goods has a history of importing into Canada, or exporting into Canada, dumped goods in respect of which the Tribunal has made an order or finding that the dumping of the goods has caused injury or retardation or a threat of injury;
- **(c)** whether the authorities of a country other than Canada have determined that injury to the domestic industry of that country was caused by the dumping of goods of the same description, or of similar goods, by an exporter of the goods that are under investigation;
- **(d)** whether there has been a significant increase in the volume of domestic inventories of the dumped or subsidized goods within a relatively short period of time; and
- **(e)** any other factors that are relevant in the circumstances.
