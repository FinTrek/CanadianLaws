- **(b)** the lands directly under that portion of an approach surface that extends beyond,
the outer limits described in Part II of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surface of any strip;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surface.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may make a direction that the owner or occupier of the land on which the object is growing remove the excessive growth.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit that land or any part of it to be used for the disposal of any waste that is edible by or attractive to birds.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(ss. 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point is a point lying perpendicularly distant 91.44 m southwesterly from a point on the centre line of runway 08-26 distant 672.9 m northwesterly from the 26 end of the said runway.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Outer Limits of Lands

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Watson Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1765 dated January 9, 1984, is described as follows:

Commencing at a point in the westerly boundary of Lot 1-67, Group 757, Plan 58737 (C.L.S.R.) 40016 (L.T.O.), where it is intersected by the circumference of a circle having a radius of 4 000 m and centred at the airport reference point as described in Part I of the schedule; thence in a northwesterly direction following the circumference of the said circle clockwise to the point where it intersects the easterly boundary of Lot 1-66, Group 757, Plan 58737 (C.L.S.R.) 40016 (L.T.O.); thence southerly along the easterly boundary of said lot to the southeast corner thereof; thence westerly along the southerly boundaries of Lots 1-66, 1-67 and across the intervening road to the southwest corner of Lot 1-67, Group 757, Plan 58737 (C.L.S.R.) 40016 (L.T.O.); thence northerly along the westerly boundary of said Lot to the point of commencement.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Watson Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1765 dated January 9, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with the runways designated 08-26 and 02-20 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 08 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line;

**(c)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 02 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 20 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip 150 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 345 m from the projected centre line; and



**(d)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 20 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 20 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip 150 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip and 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip, the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 345 m from the projected centre line.





**PART IV** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Watson Lake Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1765 dated January 9, 1984, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point except where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART V** 
## Description of the Strips

**(a)** the strip associated with runway 08-26, being 300 m in width, 150 m on each side of the centre line of the runway and 2 162 m in length; and



**(b)** the strip associated with runway 02-20, being 90 m in width, 45 m on each side of the centre line of the runway and 1 339 m in length.





**PART VI**

**(a)** the transitional surface associated with runway 08-26 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre lines produced of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip; and



**(b)** the transitional surface associated with runway 02-20 is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 5 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.
