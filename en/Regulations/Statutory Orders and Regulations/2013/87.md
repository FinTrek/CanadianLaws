## Interpretation



**Definition of List**

**1** 

- **(1)** In this Marketing Authorization, ***List*** means the List of Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for Veterinary Drugs in Foods published by the Department of Health on its website, as amended from time to time.

**Same meaning**

- **(2)** Words and expressions used in the List have the same meaning as in Part B of the [Food and Drug Regulations](/en/Regulations/Consolidated%20Regulations%20of%20Canada/801-900/C.R.C.,%20c.%20870.md).




## Exemptions



**Food**

**2** When a veterinary drug that is set out in column I of the List or one of its metabolites — and that is analysed as being the substance named in column II — is present in a food that is set out in column III, the food is exempt from the application of paragraphs 4(1)(a) and (d) of the [Food and Drugs Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-27.md) in respect of the drug and its metabolites, if the amount of the substance present in the food does not exceed the maximum residue limit that is set out in column IV for that food and if any other condition that is set out in that column is met.
