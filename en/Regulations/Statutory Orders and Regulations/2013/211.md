		- **(ii)** E.2 — perforating explosives,
		- **(iii)** E.3 — special-application explosives;
	- **(b)** I — initiation systems;
	- **(c)** P — propellant powder:
		- **(i)** P.1 — black powder and hazard category PE 1 black powder substitutes,
		- **(ii)** P.2 — smokeless powder and hazard category PE 3 black powder substitutes;
	- **(d)** C — cartridges:
		- **(i)** C.1 — <sup><a href='#fn_81000-2-29-e_hq_11133_36'>[*]</a></sup>small arms cartridges,
