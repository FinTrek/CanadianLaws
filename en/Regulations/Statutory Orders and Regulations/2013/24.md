### Class 2B and Class 3 Heavy-duty Vehicles



#### N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> Emissions



**Standards**

**20** 

- **(1)** For the 2014 model year and subsequent model years, every Class 2B and Class 3 heavy-duty vehicle and cab-complete vehicle that is not a vocational vehicle or incomplete vocational vehicle must, for the duration of its useful life, have N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emission values that do not exceed 0.05 g/mile.

**Calculation**

- **(2)** The N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emission values must be calculated in accordance with section 24.

**Fleet calculation**

- **(3)** A company that manufactures or imports vehicles referred to in subsection (1) whose N<sub>2</sub>O emission value or CH<sub>4</sub> emission value exceeds the emission standard set out in that subsection must group those vehicles of a given model year into a fleet and, if applicable, subfleets in accordance with section 18 and must calculate the N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub> emission deficit, as the case may be, for that fleet or each of those subfleets, expressed in megagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>, using the formula
```
((A – B) × C × D × E) ÷ (1 000 000)
```
where
- **A** is 0.05 g/mile;
- **B** is the N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub> family emission limit for the fleet or subfleet, as the case may be, expressed in g/mile;
- **C** is the number of vehicles in the fleet or subfleet, as the case may be;
- **D** is the vehicle’s useful life, expressed in miles; and
- **E** is the global warming potential and is equal to the following number of CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits, expressed in megagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>, needed to offset a deficit of N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub>:
- **(a)** for each megagram of N<sub>2</sub>O, 298, and
- **(b)** for each megagram of CH<sub>4</sub>,
- **(i)** for the 2020 model year and earlier model years, 25, and
- **(ii)** for the 2021 model year and subsequent model years, 34.

**Separate calculation**

- **(3.1)** For the purposes of subsection (3), if both the N<sub>2</sub>O emission value and the CH<sub>4</sub> emission value exceed 0.05 g/mile, the N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emission deficits must be calculated separately.

**Family emission limit**

- **(4)** For the purposes of subsection (3), every vehicle within a fleet or subfleet must conform to the N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub> family emission limit for the fleet or subfleet, as the case may be.

**Offsetting deficit**

- **(5)** The deficit calculated under subsection (3) must be offset by using the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits obtained in accordance with sections 34 to 47 for the averaging set in which the fleet is included.

**No credits**

- **(6)** For greater certainty, the company must not obtain CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits with respect to N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions for the purpose of participation in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credit system set out in sections 34 to 47.

```
(0.0440 × WF) + 339
```
where
- **WF** is the work factor for each vehicle subconfiguration, calculated using the formula set out in subsection (3) and rounded to the nearest pound.

- **(5)** [Repealed, SOR/2018-98, s. 24]

**Grouping subconfigurations into configurations**

- **(6)** A company may group vehicle subconfigurations of Class 2B and Class 3 heavy-duty vehicles and cab-complete vehicles — excluding those that are vocational vehicles or incomplete vocational vehicles — within a vehicle configuration for the purpose of calculating the fleet average CO<sub>2</sub> emission standard if
	- **(a)** the vehicles of each subconfiguration have the same test weight, GVWR and GCWR, and the work factor and target value are calculated assuming a curb weight equal to two times the test weight minus the GVWR; or
	- **(b)** the lowest target value of a vehicle subconfiguration is used for all vehicle subconfigurations.
> SOR/2018-98, ss. 24, 60.





**Calculation of average values**

**23** 

- **(1)** A company must calculate the fleet average CO<sub>2</sub> emission value for a given model year, expressed in grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per mile for its fleet of Class 2B and Class 3 heavy-duty vehicles and cab-complete vehicles — excluding those that are vocational vehicles or incomplete vocational vehicles — by using the formula
```
(Σ (A × B)) ÷ (C)
```
where
- **A** is the CO<sub>2</sub> emission value for each vehicle configuration calculated in accordance with section 24 and taking into account subsection (2);
- **B** is the number of vehicles of that vehicle configuration in the fleet; and
- **C** is the number of vehicles in the fleet used for the purposes of subsection (2).

**Representative data**

- **(2)** When a company calculates the fleet average CO<sub>2</sub> emission value in accordance with this section, it must use the data and values from one or more vehicle configurations that represent at least 90% of its number of vehicles for the fleet.
> SOR/2018-98, s. 60.

**Alternative standards — heavy-haul tractors**

- **(1.2)** For the 2021 model year and subsequent model years, a company may elect to have one or more of its heavy-haul tractors and incomplete tractors that are to become heavy-haul tractors conform, for the duration of their useful life, to a CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate that does not exceed the following CO<sub>2</sub> emission standard instead of having them conform to the applicable standard set out in paragraph (1.1)(c):
	- **(a)** for the 2021 to 2023 model years, 52.4 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per short ton-mile;
	- **(b)** for the 2024 to 2026 model years, 50.2 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per short ton-mile; and
	- **(c)** for the 2027 model year and subsequent model years, 48.3 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per short ton-mile.

**Modelling CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to demonstrate compliance**

- **(2)** The CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate must be determined in accordance with sections 501 and 520 of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart F, of the CFR,
	- **(a)** using the version of the GEM computer simulation model applicable for the model year in question; and
	- **(b)** in the case of tractors and incomplete tractors of the 2021 model year or a subsequent model year that are plug-in hybrid vehicles or fuel cell vehicles powered by any fuel other than hydrogen, taking into account the powertrain testing procedure set out in section 550 of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart F, of the CFR.

**Reference in CFR — interpretation**

- **(3)** For the purposes of subsection (2), a reference in the CFR to “regulatory subcategory” is to be read as a reference to the fleet referred to in one of subparagraphs 18(3)(a)(ix) to (xvi) that includes the same type of tractors and incomplete tractors as those to which the simulation model is being applied but, in the case of tractors and incomplete tractors of the 2021 model year or a subsequent model year that have a GCWR of 43 998 kg (97,000 pounds) or more, but less than 54 431 kg (120,000 pounds), is to be read as a reference to the fleet referred to in subparagraph 18(3)(a)(xiii).

**Electric vehicles**

- **(4)** For the purposes of this section and sections 34 to 47, the CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate of tractors and incomplete tractors of the 2021 model year or a subsequent model year that are electric vehicles is zero grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per short ton-mile.

**Alternative method for measuring drag area**

- **(6)** Instead of the coastdown method referred to in section 525 of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1037, subpart F, of the CFR, a company may elect to measure the tractor’s drag area (C<sub>d</sub>*A*) in accordance with any other method referred to in that section if the test results are adjusted to correlate with test results that would be obtained if the coastdown method were used, as specified in that section, and if
	- **(a)** in the case of a tractor that is covered by an EPA certificate, the election has been approved by the EPA for that tractor and the company provides the Minister with evidence of the EPA approval; and
	- **(b)** in the case of a tractor that is not covered by an EPA certificate, the company provides the Minister with evidence demonstrating that the alternative method for measuring the tractor’s drag area referred to in this subsection is more representative of that tractor’s drag area.

**Election to conform to standards for heavier tractors**

- **(7)** For any given tractor or incomplete tractor referred to in subsection (1) or (1.1) that is or is to become a Class 7 tractor, a company may elect to have it conform to the emission standards set out in subsection (1) or (1.1) that are applicable to a Class 8 tractor of the same model year with the same characteristics, for a period that is equivalent to the useful life of those Class 8 tractors, instead of the standards set out in subsection (1) or (1.1) that are applicable to Class 7 tractors.

**Calculation using fleets and subfleets**

- **(8)** A company may, instead of complying with subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) for all of its tractors and incomplete tractors of a given model year, elect to group those tractors and incomplete tractors into fleets or subfleets, as the case may be, in accordance with section 18 and participate in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credit system set out in sections 34 to 47.

**Calculation — election under subsection (7)**

- **(8.1)** If a company makes an election under subsection (7) in respect of a tractor or incomplete tractor, the company may group all of its tractors and incomplete tractors of a given model year into fleets or subfleets, as the case may be, in accordance with section 18 and participate in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credit system set out in sections 34 to 47, but must not obtain any credits or additional credits in respect of the vehicles that conform to that standard, except in accordance with sections 34 to 41 in the following cases:
	- **(a)** if the company elects to have all of its tractors or incomplete tractors that are or are to become Class 7 tractors conform to the standards that apply in respect of a Class 8 tractor of the same model year with the same characteristics, for a period that is equivalent to the useful life of those Class 8 tractors, the tractors must be grouped in the same fleet or subfleet, as the case may be, as those Class 8 tractors; and
	- **(b)** if the company elects to have one or more of its tractors or incomplete tractors that are or are to become Class 7 tractors with a heavy heavy-duty engine and a single rear axle conform to the standards that apply in respect of a Class 8 tractor of the same model year with the same characteristics, for a period that is equivalent to the useful life of those Class 8 tractors, the tractors must be grouped in the same fleet or subfleet, as the case may be, as those Class 8 tractors.

**Tractors exceeding standards under subsection (7)**

- **(8.2)** If a company makes an election under subsection (7) in respect of one or more of its tractors or incomplete tractors and the CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate of one or more of those tractors exceeds the CO<sub>2</sub> emission standard that applies in respect of Class 8 tractors of the same model year with the same characteristics, the tractors must be grouped in the same fleet or subfleet, as the case may be, as those Class 8 tractors in accordance with section 18 and the company must participate in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credit system set out in sections 34 to 47.

**Family emission limit**

- **(9)** For the purposes of subsections (8) to (8.2), every tractor and incomplete tractor included within a fleet or subfleet must conform to the CO<sub>2</sub> family emission limit for the fleet or subfleet, as the case may be.

**Values**

- **(2)** The N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emission values for the engines referred to in subsection (1) correspond to the emission values of the tested engine configuration referred to in section 235(a) of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1036, subpart C, of the CFR, for the engine family, measured in accordance with the transient duty cycle, taking into account sections 108(d) to (f) and 150(g) of subpart B, sections 235(b) and 241(c) and (d) of subpart C and subparts E and F of part 1036, Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, of the CFR.

**Engine configuration**

- **(3)** For the purposes of subsection (2), the tested engine configuration for the model year in question is determined using the engine sales in Canada if none of the engines of the engine family are sold in the United States.

**Fleet calculation**

- **(4)** A company that manufactures or imports engines referred to in subsection (1) whose N<sub>2</sub>O emission value or CH<sub>4</sub> emission value exceeds the emission standard set out in that subsection must group those engines of a given model year into fleets in accordance with section 18 and must calculate the N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub> emission deficit, as the case may be, for each of those fleets, expressed in megagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>, using the formula
```
((A – B) × C × D × E × F) ÷ (1 000 000)
```
where
- **A** is 0.10 g/BHP-hr;
- **B** is the N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub> family emission limit for the fleet, as the case may be, expressed in g/BHP-hr;

- **E** is the engine’s useful life, expressed in miles; and
- **F** is the global warming potential and is equal to the following number of CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits, expressed in megagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>, needed to offset a deficit of N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub>:
- **(a)** for each megagram of N<sub>2</sub>O, 298; and
- **(b)** for each megagram of CH<sub>4</sub>,
- **(i)** for the 2020 model year and earlier model years, 25, and
- **(ii)** for the 2021 model year and subsequent model years, 34.

**Separate calculation**

- **(4.1)** For the purposes of subsection (4), if both the N<sub>2</sub>O emission value and the CH<sub>4</sub> emission value exceed 0.10 g/BHP-hr, the N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emission deficits must be calculated separately.

**Family emission limit**

- **(5)** For the purposes of subsection (4), every heavy-duty engine within a fleet must conform to the N<sub>2</sub>O or CH<sub>4</sub> family emission limit for the fleet.

**Offsetting fleet emission deficit**

- **(6)** The deficit calculated under subsection (4) must be offset by using the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits obtained in accordance with sections 34 to 47 for the averaging set in which the fleet is included.

**No credits**

- **(7)** For greater certainty, and subject to subsection (8), the company must not obtain CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits with respect to N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions for the purpose of participation in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credit system set out in sections 34 to 47.

**Credits for low N<sub>2</sub>O emissions**

- **(8)** If a company’s heavy-duty engines from a fleet of the 2014, 2015 or 2016 model year conform to an N<sub>2</sub>O family emission limit that is less than 0.04 g/BHP-hr, the company may obtain CO<sub>2</sub> emission credits for the purpose of participation in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission credit system set out in sections 34 to 47. The credits must be calculated using the following formula, for each fleet, and be expressed in megagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>:
```
((A – B) × C × D × E × F) ÷ (1 000 000)
```
where
- **A** is 0.04 g/BHP-hr;
- **B** is the N<sub>2</sub>O family emission limit for the fleet, expressed in g/BHP-hr;
- **C** is the number of engines in the fleet;
- **D** is the transient cycle conversion factor calculated in accordance with the applicable variable “CF” in section 705(b) of Title 40, chapter I, subchapter U, part 1036, subpart H, of the CFR, except that a reference to “production volumes” in that section must be read as a reference to “number of engines of that engine family that a company imports or manufactures in Canada for the purpose of sale in Canada to the first retail purchaser”;
