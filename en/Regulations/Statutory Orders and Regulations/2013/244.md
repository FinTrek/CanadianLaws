## Funding



**Solvency standards**

**4** The funding of any plan is considered to meet the standards for solvency if the funding is in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations.




**Funding during each plan year**

**5** 

- **(1)** Every plan must be funded in each plan year by
	- **(a)** contributions that are equal to the normal cost of the plan;
	- **(b)** the amount that is determined under subsection (2); and
	- **(c)** the amount that is required to be paid by an employer under a defined contribution provision in that plan.

**Special payment**

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the amount required to be paid to each plan for a plan year is equal to the amount determined
	- **(a)** in the case where the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans is equal to or greater than $150,000,000, by the formula
```
A x B/C
```
where
- **A** is $150,000,000,
- **B** is the amount of the solvency deficiency of the plan, and
- **C** is the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans; or
	- **(b)** in the case where the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans is less than $150,000,000, by the formula
```
D + ($150,000,000 – E) x F/G
```
where
- **D** is the amount of the solvency deficiency of the plan,
- **E** is the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans,
- **F** is the amount of the solvency liabilities of the plan, and
- **G** is the aggregate amount of the solvency liabilities of all plans.

**Funding for 2020 plan year**

- **(3)** Unless the whole of the pension plan is terminated or unless Air Canada provides notice in accordance with subsection 6(1), the plan must also be funded, for the 2020 plan year, by the amount that is determined under subsection (4), and that amount must be paid by December 31, 2020.

**Special payment for 2020 plan year**

- **(4)** For the purposes of subsection (3), the amount required to be paid to each plan for the plan year is equal to the amount determined
	- **(a)** in the case where the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans is equal to or greater than the amount determined by the formula set out in A, by the formula
```
A x (B/C)
```
where
- **A** is the amount obtained by the formula
```
($200,000,000 × D) – [($150,000,000 x D) + E]
```
where
- **D** is the number of plan years that are after the 2013 plan year, and
- **E** are the amounts paid for those plan years that are in addition to the amounts required to be paid in accordance with subsection (1),
- **B** is the amount of the solvency deficiency of the plan, and
- **C** is the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans; or
	- **(b)** in the case where the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans is less than the amount determined by the formula set out in G, by the formula
```
F + (G – H) x I/J
```
where
- **F** is the amount of the solvency deficiency of the plan,
- **G** is the amount obtained by the formula
```
($200,000,000 × K) – [($150,000,000 x K) + L]
```
where
- **K** is the number of plan years that are after the 2013 plan year, and
- **L** are the amounts paid for those plan years that are in addition to the amounts required to be paid in accordance with subsection (1),
- **H** is the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans,
- **I** is the amount of the solvency liabilities of the plan, and

**Interest rate**

- **(5)** If an employer fails to make the payment to the plan that is referred to in subsection (3) within the period that is set out in that subsection, the amount that must be paid in accordance with that subsection is to bear interest at the rate that was used to determine the solvency liabilities of the plan.




**Discontinuance of funding — notice to the Superintendent**

**6** 

- **(1)** If, on or before the earlier of the day on which the actuarial report is filed with the Superintendent for a plan year and June 30 of that plan year, Air Canada provides written notice to the Superintendent indicating its choice to discontinue funding of all the Air Canada pension plans under these Regulations for that plan year, these Regulations, except subsections 1(1), 3(3) and (4), this section and section 12, cease to apply to the plans on December 31 of the previous plan year.

**Special payment — notice**

- **(3)** Each plan must be funded for the plan year in which the notice was provided in accordance with subsection (1) by an amount that must be paid within 30 days after that notice has been provided and is equal to the amount determined
	- **(a)** in the case where the aggregate amount of the solvency deficiencies of all plans is equal to or greater than the amount determined by the formula set out in A, by the formula
```
A × (B/C)
```
where
- **A** is the amount obtained by the formula
```
($200,000,000 × D) – [($150,000,000 x D) + E]
```
where
- **D** is the number of plan years that are after the 2013 plan year, excluding the year in which the notice is provided, and
- **E** are the amounts paid for those plan years that are in addition to the amounts required to be paid in accordance with subsection 5(1),

```
F + (G – H) x I/J
```
where
- **F** is the amount of the solvency deficiency of the plan,
- **G** is the amount obtained by the formula
```
($200,000,000 × K) – [($150,000,000 x K) + L]

**Average solvency ratio**

- **(5)** In respect of the plan year in which the notice under subsection (1) has been provided, the average solvency ratio for each plan must be adjusted by increasing the solvency assets by the amount determined under subsection (3).

**7** Section 9.3 of the [Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985](/en/Regulations/Statutory%20Orders%20and%20Regulations/87/19.md), with the exception of subsection 9.3(2), does not apply in respect of an Air Canada pension plan.
