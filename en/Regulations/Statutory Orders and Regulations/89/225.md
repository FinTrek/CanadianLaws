## Classification Society Surveys or Inspections


**5** 

- **(1)** A survey or inspection of the hull, machinery and anchor equipment of a ship, other than a first inspection, that is made at a place in Canada by an exclusive surveyor to a classification society is deemed to be made by a steamship inspector.

- **(2)** A survey or inspection referred to in subsection (1) shall consist of a survey or inspection of all of the items set out in the schedule, to verify that each item is sufficient for the service intended and in good condition.
> SOR/92-457, s. 3.





## Reports of Exclusive Surveyors to a Classification Society


**6** A report may be accepted by the Chairman or a steamship inspector if
- **(a)** the owner of a ship or a representative of the owner has given written notice to the Chairman of an intention to have the ship surveyed or inspected by an exclusive surveyor to a classification society, during a period of not less than five years after the date of the notice;
- **(b)** the ship is in class and the results of the most recent survey made by a classification society for the purpose of classification of the ship are provided with the notice referred to in paragraph (a);
- **(c)** all remedial action that is required as a result of a survey referred to in paragraph (b) has been taken and the relevant classification society provides a written statement that the ship is recommended for retention in class, which statement shall accompany the notice referred to in paragraph (a);
- **(d)** where a ship has been suspended, withheld or withdrawn from class during the period referred to in paragraph (a), a five year period beginning on the date of the suspension, withholding or withdrawal from class has expired;
- **(e)** in the report, the exclusive surveyor to the classification society certifies in writing that
	- **(i)** the survey or inspection of the hull, machinery and anchor equipment was carried out in accordance with the Act and any regulations made under the Act respecting inspection by a steamship inspector,
	- **(ii)** the exclusive surveyor recommends that the ship be retained in class, and
	- **(iii)** in the opinion of the exclusive surveyor, the hull, machinery and anchor equipment of the ship are
		- **(A)** sufficient for the service intended and in good condition, and
		- **(B)** constructed, arranged and fitted in accordance with the regulations made under Part VIII of the Act;
- **(f)** in respect of the ship, the classification society on whose behalf the report is made maintains a complete ship inspection record file and provides the Chairman with the record file for examination on request; and
- **(g)** the report is in the English or French language.

**7** For the purposes of these Regulations, the longer period referred to in paragraph 316(2)(b) of the Act for surveys or inspections of the hull, machinery and anchor equipment of a ship is
- **(a)** 25 years after the date of completion of the initial construction, in the case of a dry cargo ship or tug that is certificated for voyages not exceeding the limits of an inland voyage; or
- **(b)** 20 years after the date of completion of the initial construction, in the case of a tug that is certificated for voyages outside the limits of an inland voyage.
> SOR/92-457, s. 5.





## Validity of Certificates


**8** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2) and section 9, an inspection certificate issued in respect of a ship by the Chairman or by a steamship inspector ceases to be valid where

	- **(b)** the ship is suspended, withheld or withdrawn from class;
	- **(c)** the classification society referred to in paragraph 6(f) has failed to comply with that paragraph;
	- **(d)** the ship is transferred from one classification society to another; or
	- **(e)** the owner or master of the ship fails to comply with subsection 377(1) of the Act.

- **(2)** A certificate referred to in subsection (1) remains valid in the circumstances set out in paragraphs (1)(a) to (e) until the Chairman gives to the owner of the ship a written notice setting out the reasons why the certificate is no longer valid.
> SOR/92-457, s. 6.




**9** On transfer of a ship from one classification society to another, the certificate referred to in subsection 8(1) ceases to be valid unless
- **(a)** immediately after the transfer, a survey or inspection is made of the ship by the other classification society of the items referred to in subsection 5(2), in the presence of a steamship inspector; and
- **(b)** the ship is brought in class by the other classification society.
