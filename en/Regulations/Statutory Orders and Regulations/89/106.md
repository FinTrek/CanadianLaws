**33** 

- **(1)** No person shall
	- **(a)** commence fumigation of the contents of a mobile unit that is on board a ship; or
	- **(b)** load a mobile unit onto a ship unless
		- **(i)** in the opinion of a competent person, the concentration of fumigant is reasonably uniform throughout the mobile unit, and
		- **(ii)** the master of the ship has been informed that the contents of the mobile unit have been fumigated.

- **(2)** Every mobile unit shall have a placard attached to the mobile unit that clearly shows, in English and in French,
	- **(a)** the name of the fumigant that was used to fumigate the mobile unit; and
	- **(b)** the date and time when the fumigant was used to fumigate.



**34** All shipping documents in respect of a mobile unit on board a ship shall include the following information:
- **(a)** the type and amount of fumigant that was used to fumigate the mobile unit;
- **(b)** the date and time when the fumigant was used to fumigate;
- **(c)** the location of each mobile unit on board the ship; and
- **(d)** instructions for disposal of any of the fumigant that is not in a gaseous state.



**35** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), every mobile unit on board a ship shall be stowed on an open deck at least six metres from crew accommodation, any passenger accommodation, a work area or ship ventilation intake.

- **(2)** Where authorized in writing by the flag administration in respect of the ship, a mobile unit may be stowed below deck in a ship that is equipped with a mechanical ventilation system that operates in the space where the unit is stowed.
