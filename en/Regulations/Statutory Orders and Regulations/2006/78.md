The strip surface commences 60.000 m to the west of threshold 07 and ends 60.000 m to the east of threshold 25, having a total length of 2 253.600 m. The 07 end of the strip surface has an elevation of 311.700 m and the 25 end of the strip surface has an elevation of 321.500 m. The azimuth of the centreline from threshold 07 to threshold 25 is 64°42′56″.
