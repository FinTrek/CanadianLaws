----------

Whereas, pursuant to section 40 of the [Canada Transportation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2010.md), the Laurentian Pilotage Authority has petitioned the Governor in Council to rescind Decision No. 618-W-2005 of the Canadian Transportation Agency dated October 14, 2005;

Whereas section 33 of the [Pilotage Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-14.md)<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup> provides that a Pilotage Authority shall, with the approval of the Governor in Council, make regulations prescribing tariffs of pilotage charges to be paid to that Authority for pilotage and that all such tariffs shall be fixed at a level that permits the Authority to operate on a selfsustaining financial basis and shall be fair and reasonable;

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: S.C. 1998, c. 10, s. 149<br />

And whereas the Governor in Council is of the opinion that the tariff increases that the Laurentian Pilotage Authority published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on March 5, 2005, and in force on July 1, 2005<sup><a href='#footnoteb_e'>[b]</a></sup>, are not prejudicial to the public interest;

<a name='footnoteb_e'><sup>b</sup></a>: SOR/2005-162<br />

Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, pursuant to section 40 of the [Canada Transportation Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2010.md), hereby rescinds Decision No. 618-W-2005 of the Canadian Transportation Agency.
