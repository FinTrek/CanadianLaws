**Content of notice**

- **(2)** The notice must identify all defaulting members and the amount of the shortfall attributable to each of them.

**Defaulting member’s charge**

- **(b)** to the council of each borrowing member who is not a defaulting member, a notice requiring that member to pay a charge equal to the one determined by the formula
```
[A/(B – C)] × (D – E)
```

- **B** is the aggregate gross annual property tax revenue of all the borrowing members,

- **(b)** to the council of each borrowing member who is not a defaulting member, a notice requiring that member to pay a charge equal to the one determined by the formula
```

```
