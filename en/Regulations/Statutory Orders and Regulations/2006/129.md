	- **(b)** ships that carry permanent ballast water in sealed tanks such that it is not subject to discharge; or
	- **(c)** ships that are owned or operated by a state and used in government non-commercial service.




## Compliance


**3** The owner of a ship and the master of a ship shall ensure that the requirements set out in sections 4 to 10 and 13 are met.




## Ballast Water Management


**4** 

- **(1)** For the purposes of this section, a ship manages ballast water if it employs, either separately or in combination, the following management processes:
	- **(a)** the exchange of ballast water;
	- **(b)** the treatment of ballast water;
	- **(c)** the discharge of ballast water to a reception facility; and
	- **(d)** the retention of ballast water on board the ship.

- **(2)** A ship carrying ballast water taken on board the ship outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction shall manage the ballast water in accordance with these Regulations in order to
	- **(a)** minimize both the uptake of harmful aquatic organisms or pathogens within the ballast water and their discharge with the ballast water into waters under Canadian jurisdiction; or
	- **(b)** remove or render harmless harmful aquatic organisms or pathogens within the ballast water.

- **(3)** A ship shall manage ballast water taken on board the ship in waters under Canadian jurisdiction, in the United States waters of the Great Lakes Basin or in the French waters of the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon if the ballast water is mixed with other ballast water that was taken on board the ship outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction and that was not previously subjected to a management process set out in paragraph (1)(a) or (b).

- **(4)** It is not necessary to manage ballast water if the ship operates exclusively
	- **(a)** between ports, offshore terminals or anchorage areas situated on the west coast of North America north of Cape Blanco; or
	- **(b)** between ports, offshore terminals or anchorage areas situated on the east coast of North America north of Cape Cod and ports, offshore terminals or anchorage areas situated
		- **(i)** in the Bay of Fundy,
		- **(ii)** on the east coast of Nova Scotia, or
		- **(iii)** on the south or east coast of the island of Newfoundland.

- **(5)** It is not necessary to manage ballast water if one of the following emergency situations occurs:
	- **(a)** the discharge or uptake of ballast water is necessary for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the ship in emergency situations or saving life at sea;
	- **(b)** the discharge or uptake of ballast water is necessary for the purpose of avoiding or minimizing the discharge of a pollutant from the ship; or
	- **(c)** the accidental ingress or discharge of ballast water results from damage to the ship or its equipment that was not caused by a wilful or reckless act of the owner or officer in charge and all reasonable precautions are taken before and after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the damage for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the ingress or discharge.



**5** 

- **(1)** A ship on a voyage to the Great Lakes Basin that carries only residual amounts of ballast water that were taken on board the ship outside waters under Canadian jurisdiction and were not previously subjected to a management process set out in paragraph 4(1)(a) or (b) is not required to comply with subsection 4(3) if the ship
	- **(a)** complies with sections 1, 2, 6 and 7 of the Code of Best Practices for Ballast Water Management, published by the Shipping Federation of Canada on September 28, 2000, while the ship operates in waters under Canadian jurisdiction in the Great Lakes Basin; or
	- **(b)** conducts a saltwater flushing of ballast water tanks that contain the residual amounts of ballast water in an area at least 200 nautical miles from shore before entering waters under Canadian jurisdiction.

- **(2)** For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a saltwater flushing means the addition of mid-ocean water to ballast water tanks that contain the residual amounts of ballast water, the mixing of the flush water with the residual water and sediment in the tanks through the motion of the ship and the discharge of the mixed water so that the salinity of the resulting residual ballast water in the tanks exceeds 30 parts per thousand or is as close to 30 parts per thousand as possible.

- **(3)** A ship that complies with the requirements of subsection (1) shall carry on board the ship for at least 24 months a record that demonstrates compliance with those requirements.




## Ballast Water Exchange — Transoceanic Navigation
