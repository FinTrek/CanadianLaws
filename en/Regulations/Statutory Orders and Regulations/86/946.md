		- **(i)** the duties otherwise payable on the goods, and
		- **(ii)** the duties that would be payable on the goods if, after the percentage of polarization of the goods is determined, there is deducted from that percentage an amount equal to five times the percentage of salt present in that portion of the water found in the damaged goods that is in excess of the water found in samples of undamaged goods, as certified by an officer authorized to test such samples; and

- **(2)** No abatement of duties shall be granted under subsection (1) in respect of any loss in volume or weight in excess of one sixth of one per cent of the original volume or weight multiplied by the number of months that have elapsed since the date of original warehousing or eight per cent of the original volume or weight, whichever is the lesser.




## Abatement Not to Be Granted
