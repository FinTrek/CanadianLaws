## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Determination of the Tariff Classification of Sugar, Molasses and Sugar Syrup Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** In these Regulations, ***ICUMSA*** means the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (*ICUMSA*).




## Application


**3** The tariff classification for sugar shall be determined from the results of analysis for polarization obtained by following the method adopted by ICUMSA and known as Method No. 1, first issued in 1958, as amended from time to time.
> SOR/98-241, s. 1.




**4** The tariff classification for molasses and sugar syrup shall be determined from the results of analysis obtained by following one of the two methods for ascertaining reducing sugars adopted by ICUMSA set out in the schedule.
> SOR/88-533, s. 1.




**5** Sugar polarimeters, polarimeter cells, volumetric glassware and other laboratory apparatus and reagents used in the determination of the tariff classification of sugar, molasses and sugar syrup shall meet the appropriate ICUMSA standards.
