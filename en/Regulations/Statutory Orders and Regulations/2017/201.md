## Strip Surfaces

The elevation of a strip surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centreline of that strip surface. The elevation of the strip surface centreline between the strip surface end and the closest strip surface threshold is equal to the elevation of the strip surface end. The elevation of the strip surface centreline between the strip surface thresholds is calculated using a constant ratio between the elevations of the strip surface thresholds.


The strip surfaces, as shown on the zoning plan, are imaginary rectangular surfaces described as follows:

**(a)** the strip surface associated with runway 06R-24L is 300 m in total width, being 150 m on either side of the centreline of the runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the southwest of threshold 06R and ends 60 m to the northeast of threshold 24L, having a total length of 3 047.66 m. The 06R end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 29.91 m and the 24L end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 36.09 m. The azimuth of the centreline of runway 06R-24L is 42°51′06″. Threshold 06R has grid coordinates of N 5 035 331.436 and E 285 921.018 and threshold 24L has grid coordinates of N 5 037 477.546 and E 287 911.936;



**(b)** the strip surface associated with runway 06L-24R is 300 m in total width, being 150 m on either side of the centreline of the runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the southwest of threshold 06L and ends 60 m to the northeast of threshold 24R, having a total length of 3 474.19 m. The 06L end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 29.44 m and the 24R end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 32.45 m. The azimuth of the centreline of runway 06L-24R is 42°49′42″. Threshold 06L has grid coordinates of N 5 035 716.754 and E 284 076.255 and threshold 24R has grid coordinates of N 5 038 176.455 and E 286 356.220; and



**(c)** the strip surface associated with runway 10-28 is 300 m in total width, being 150 m on either side of the centreline of the runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the west of threshold 10 and ends 60 m to the east of threshold 28, having a total length of 2 254.35 m. The 10 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 29.28 m and the 28 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 30.29 m. The azimuth of the centreline of runway 10-28 is 87°48′23″. Threshold 10 has grid coordinates of N 5 035 895.648 and E 284 009.608 and threshold 28 has grid coordinates of N 5 035 977.331 and E 286 142.184.





**PART 5** 
## Transitional Surfaces

Each transitional surface, as shown on the zoning plan, is an imaginary inclined surface ascending at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centreline and projected centreline of the strip surface, and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces to the intersection with the outer surface.


The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting a strip surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centreline of the abutting strip surface. The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting an approach surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centreline of the abutting approach surface.
