Whereas section 4 of the [Visiting Forces Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/V/V-2.md), chapter V-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, provides that the Governor in Council may, by proclamation, designate any country as a designated state for the purposes of that Act, declare the extent to which that Act is applicable in respect of any designated state and designate civilian personnel as a civilian component of a visiting force;

Now Know You that We, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada, pursuant to Order in Council P.C. 2017-260 of March 24, 2017, do by this Our Proclamation

**(a)** designate the Republic of Montenegro as a designated state for the purposes of the [Visiting Forces Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/V/V-2.md);

**(c)** designate, as a civilian component of a visiting force from the Republic of Montenegro, the civilian personnel in the employ of that force in Canada who are not stateless persons, nationals of any state that is not a designated state or citizens or residents of Canada.



Of all which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these presents may concern are required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, We have caused this Our Proclamation to be published and the Great Seal of Canada to be affixed to it.
