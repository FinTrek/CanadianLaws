- **(a)** the marking of the goods is in accordance with the marking laws of an EU country or other CETA beneficiary and indicates that the goods are the product of an EU country or other CETA beneficiary or of Canada; or
- **(b)** the goods do not bear a mark and nothing indicates that the goods are neither the product of an EU country or other CETA beneficiary nor the product of Canada.
