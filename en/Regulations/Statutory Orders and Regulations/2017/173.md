- **(f)** any other information requested by the Minister for clarification purposes related to the application.




**Considerations to be taken into account**

**3** The Minister shall take the following considerations into account when deciding whether to issue an export allocation:
- **(a)** whether the exporter or, if applicable, the agent or mandatary has furnished the information required by these Regulations;
- **(b)** whether the exporter has complied with the provisions of the Act, or the regulations made under the [Export and Import Permits Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/E/E-19.md), or any condition of an export allocation or export permit; and
- **(c)** whether the exporter has furnished false or misleading information in connection with any reports required by the Act, or the regulations made under the Act, or in connection with any term or condition of an export allocation or export permit.




**Information to be supplied**

**4** Every person to whom an export allocation has been issued shall provide the Minister with the following information:
- **(a)** any information required by the Minister for clarification purposes related to the export allocation; and
- **(b)** a detailed report of the circumstances of the person or of any other person who has failed or will likely fail to comply with the requirements of these Regulations with respect to a product to which the allocation relates or with the terms or conditions of the allocation as soon as the holder becomes aware of those circumstances.




**Issuance of export allocation**

**5** When an application for an export allocation has been approved by the Minister, the written approval of the Minister becomes a valid export allocation.
