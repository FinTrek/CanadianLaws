----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 5.5(1)<sup><a href='#fn_2-188e_hq_12007'>[a]</a></sup> of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md)<sup><a href='#fn_2-188e_hq_12010'>[b]</a></sup>, a notice of the proposed John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport Zoning Regulations was published in the Hamilton Spectator on March 16 and 23, 2016, the Brantford Expositor on March 16 and 23, 2016, the Brant News on March 17 and 24, 2016 and the Régional on March 16 and 23, 2016, a copy of the proposed Regulations, substantially in the annexed form, was published in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette, Part I, on March 5 and 12, 2016, and a reasonable opportunity was afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of Transport with respect to the proposed Regulations;

<a name='fn_2-188e_hq_12007'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1<br />

<a name='fn_2-188e_hq_12010'><sup>b</sup></a>: R.S., c. A-2<br />

Whereas a purpose of the proposed Regulations is to prevent lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport from being used or developed in a manner that is, in the opinion of the Minister of Transport, incompatible with the safe operation of an airport or aircraft;

**PART 4** 
## Strip Surfaces

The elevation of a strip surface at any point is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of that strip surface. The elevation of the strip surface centre line between the strip surface end and the closest strip surface threshold is equal to the elevation of the strip surface end. The elevation of the strip surface centre line between the strip surface thresholds is calculated using a constant ratio between the elevations of the strip surface thresholds and the elevations of the points along the runway centre line that are set out in the tables to this Part.


The strip surfaces, as shown on sheets 21 and 22 of the zoning plan, are imaginary rectangular surfaces described as follows:

**(a)** Strip Surface 06-24 is 300 m in total width, being 150 m on either side of the centre line of the runway. The strip surface commences 60 m to the southwest of threshold 06 and ends 60 m to the northeast of threshold 24, having a total length of 2 864.40 m. The 06 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 228.30 m and the 24 end of the strip surface has an assigned elevation of 230.30 m. The azimuth of the centre line of runway 06-24 is 48°00′09″. Threshold 06 has grid coordinates of 585 918.65 E and 4 779 270.52 N and threshold 24 has grid coordinates of 587 957.53 E and 4 781 106.17 N. The points between thresholds along strip surface 06-24 that determine the elevation of the strip surface centre line are set out in the following table:

## Transitional Surfaces

The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting a strip surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of the abutting strip surface. The elevation of a point on the lower edge of a transitional surface abutting an approach surface is equal to the elevation of the nearest point on the centre line of the abutting approach surface.


Each transitional surface, as shown on sheets 16 to 18, 20 to 23, 27 and 28 of the zoning plan, is an imaginary inclined surface that extends upward and outward, from the lateral limits of the abutting strip surface and the abutting approach surface, at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally and at right angles to the centre line of each abutting strip surface and approach surface to the intersection with the outer surface, or with another transitional surface.



**PART 6** 
## Limit of Area Containing Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The limit of the area containing the lands to which these Regulations apply, as shown on sheets 1 to 40 of the zoning plan, is generally defined by the outer limit of the area covered by the approach surfaces, the outer surface, the strip surfaces, the transitional surfaces and the wildlife hazard zone. The limit is located in the City of Hamilton, the County of Brant, and Haldimand County, and is described as follows:

commencing at the intersection of the southern limit of Rymal Road West (Road Allowance between the Townships of Barton and Glanford as widened) with the eastern limit of Glancaster Road (Road Allowance between the Townships of Ancaster and Glanford) being the northwest corner of Part 1 on Plan 62R-14989 (see sheet 17);
