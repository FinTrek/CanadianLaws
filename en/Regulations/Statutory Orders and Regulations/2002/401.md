### Property, Funds and Assets


**4** 

- **(1)** UNESCO, its property and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except in so far as in any particular case UNESCO has expressly waived its immunity. No waiver of immunity extends to any measure of execution except with UNESCO’s express consent.

- **(2)** The property and assets of UNESCO, wherever located and by whomsoever held, are immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action.



**5** Without being restricted by financial controls, regulations or moratoria of any kind, UNESCO may

**8** 

- **(1)** UNESCO, its assets, income and other property are

	- **(c)** exempt from customs duties and prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports in respect of its publications.

- **(2)** UNESCO shall not, as a general rule, claim exemption from excise duties and from taxes on the sale of movable and immovable property which form part of the price to be paid.

### Communications


**9**

- **(2)** No censorship shall be applied to the official correspondence and other official communications of UNESCO.

- **(6)** Privileges and immunities are accorded to the representatives of a member not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves, but in order to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions in connection with UNESCO.
