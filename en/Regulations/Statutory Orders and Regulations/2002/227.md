**Requirement**

- **(2)** A foreign national who is issued a departure order must meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 240(1)(a) to (c) within 30 days after the order becomes enforceable, failing which the departure order becomes a deportation order.

**Exception — stay of removal and detention**

- **(3)** If the foreign national is detained within the 30-day period or the removal order against them is stayed, the 30-day period is suspended until the foreign national’s release or the removal order becomes enforceable.

**Stay of removal — humanitarian and compassionate or public policy considerations**

**When removal order is enforced**

**240** 

- **(1)** A removal order against a foreign national, whether it is enforced by voluntary compliance or by the Minister, is enforced when the foreign national

	- **(b)** obtains a certificate of departure from the Department;
	- **(c)** departs from Canada; and
	- **(d)** is authorized to enter, other than for purposes of transit, their country of destination.

**When removal order is enforced by officer outside Canada**

- **(2)** If a foreign national against whom a removal order has not been enforced is applying outside Canada for a visa or an authorization to return to Canada, an officer shall enforce the order if, following an examination, the foreign national establishes that
	- **(a)** they are the person described in the order;
	- **(b)** they have been lawfully admitted to the country in which they are physically present at the time that the application is made; and
	- **(c)** they are not inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality.

	- **(c)** a country of which they are a national or citizen; or
	- **(d)** the country of their birth.

**Removal to another country**

- **(2)** If none of the countries referred to in subsection (1) is willing to authorize the foreign national to enter, the Minister shall select any country that will authorize entry within a reasonable time and shall remove the foreign national to that country.

**Exception**

- **(3)** Despite section 238 and subsection (1), the Minister shall remove a person who is subject to a removal order on the grounds of inadmissibility referred to in paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Act to a country that the Minister determines will authorize the person to enter.

	- **(ii)** section 6 (importing and exporting), and
	- **(iii)** section 7 (production);
- **(f)** conviction outside Canada, or the existence of pending charges outside Canada, for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament for

- **(g)** conviction outside Canada, or the existence of pending charges outside Canada, for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under any of the following provisions of the [Controlled Drugs and Substances Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1996/c.%2019.md), namely,
	- **(i)** section 5 (trafficking),

- **(2)** Consideration of the factors set out in paragraph (1)(a) shall not have an adverse impact with respect to minor children referred to in section 249.
> SOR/2004-167, s. 65(E).





**Other factors**

**248** If it is determined that there are grounds for detention, the following factors shall be considered before a decision is made on detention or release:
- **(a)** the reason for detention;
- **(b)** the length of time in detention;
- **(c)** whether there are any elements that can assist in determining the length of time that detention is likely to continue and, if so, that length of time;

- **(a)** the availability of alternative arrangements with local child-care agencies or child protection services for the care and protection of the minor children;
- **(b)** the anticipated length of detention;
- **(c)** the risk of continued control by the human smugglers or traffickers who brought the children to Canada;
- **(d)** the type of detention facility envisaged and the conditions of detention;
- **(e)** the availability of accommodation that allows for the segregation of the minor children from adult detainees who are not the parent of or the adult legally responsible for the detained minor children; and
- **(f)** the availability of services in the detention facility, including education, counselling and recreation.




**Applications for travel documents**

**250** If a completed application for a passport or travel document must be provided as a condition of release from detention, any completed application provided by a foreign national who makes a claim for refugee protection shall not be divulged to government officials of their country of nationality or, if there is no country of nationality, their country of previous habitual residence, as long as the removal order to which the foreign national is subject is not enforceable.
