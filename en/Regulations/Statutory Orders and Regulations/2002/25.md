- **(3)** The returning officer shall, on the day on which he or she receives an affidavit of objection or on the following day, send to the person objected to, at his or her address given on the list of electors and also at any other address given on the affidavit, a notice in the prescribed form advising the person that he or she may give evidence to show that he or she is entitled to vote in the electoral district in question by
	- **(a)** appearing personally or by representative before the returning officer at a specified time no later than the 11th day before polling day; or
