**PART 3** 
## Regional Value Content


**4** 

- **(1)** Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), the regional value content of a good shall be calculated on the basis of the following transaction value method:
```
RVC = (TV - VNM) ÷ (TV) × 100
```
where
- **RVC** is the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage;
- **TV** is the transaction value of the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; and

- **(2)** For an automotive good of headings 87.01 through 87.02, subheadings 8703.21 through 8703.90 or headings 87.04 through 87.08, the regional value content shall be calculated on the basis of the following net cost method:
```
RVC = (TV - VNM) ÷ (TV) × 100
```
where
- **RVC** is the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage;
- **NC** is the net cost of the good calculated in accordance with subsection (6); and
- **VNM** is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined in accordance with section 5.

- **(3)** For an automotive good of subheadings 8407.31 through 8407.34 or subheading 8703.10, the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value method set out in subsection (1) or the net cost method set out in subsection (2).

- **(4)** For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good under subsection (1) or (2), the value of non-originating materials used by a producer in the production of the good shall not include
	- **(a)** the value of any non-originating materials used by another producer in the production of originating materials that are subsequently acquired and used by the producer of the good in the production of that good; or
	- **(b)** the value of any non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of an originating intermediate material.

- **(5)** For purposes of subsection (4), where an originating intermediate material is used by the producer of the good with non-originating materials (whether or not those non-originating materials are produced by that producer) in the production of the good, the value of those non-originating materials shall be included in the value of non-originating materials.

- **(6)** For purposes of subsection (2), the net cost of a good may be calculated, at the choice of the producer of the good, by
	- **(a)** calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtracting any excluded costs that are included in that total cost and reasonably allocating the remainder to the good;
	- **(b)** calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating that total cost to the good and subtracting any excluded costs that are included in the amount allocated to that good; or
	- **(c)** reasonably allocating each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of those costs does not include any excluded costs.

- **(7)** For purposes of calculating net cost under subsection (6), excluded costs that are included in the value of a material that is used in the production of the good shall not be subtracted from or otherwise excluded from the total cost.

*For purposes of the above note, average yarn number, as applied to woven fabrics of cotton or man-made fibres, means the average yarn number of the yarns contained therein. In computing the average yarn number, the length of the yarn is considered to be equal to the distance covered by it in the fabric, with all clipped yarn being measured as if continuous and with thecount being taken of the total single yarns in the fabric including the single yarns in any multiple (folded) or cabled yarns. The weight shall be taken after any excessive sizing is removed by boiling or other suitable process. Any of the following formulas can be used to determine the average yarn number:*


```
*N = BYT1,000,100TZ′,BTZ or ST10*
```
*when:*
- **N** *is the average yarn number,*
- **B** *is the breadth (width) of the fabric in centimetres,*
- **Y** *is the metres (linear) of the fabric per kilogram,*
- **T** *is the total single yarns per square centimetre,*
- **S** *is the square metres of fabric per kilogram,*
- **Z** *is the grams per linear metre of fabric, and*
- *Z′**is the grams per square metre of fabric.*

## Fungible Materials


### Interpretation

**1** The following definitions apply in this Part,

***average method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under section 5, of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory. (*méthode de la moyenne*)

***FIFO method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible materials first received in materials inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory. (*méthode PEPS*)

***LIFO method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible materials last received in materials inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible materials first withdrawn from materials inventory. (*méthode DEPS*)

***materials inventory*** means
- **(a)** with respect to a producer of a good, an inventory of fungible materials that are used in the production of the good, and
- **(b)** with respect to a person from whom the producer of the good acquired those fungible materials, an inventory from which fungible materials are sold or otherwise transferred to the producer of the good. (*stock de matières*)

***opening inventory*** means the materials inventory at the time an inventory management method is chosen. (*stock d’ouverture*)

***origin identifier*** means any mark that identifies fungible materials as originating materials or non-originating materials. (*identificateur d’origine*)



### General

**2** The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible materials referred to in paragraph 5(8)(a) of these Regulations are originating materials are the following:
- **(a)** specific identification method;
- **(b)** FIFO method;
- **(c)** LIFO method; and
- **(d)** average method.


**3** Where a producer of a good or a person from whom the producer acquired the materials that are used in the production of the good chooses an inventory management method referred to in section 2, that method, including the averaging period chosen in the case of the average method, shall be used from the time the choice is made until the end of the fiscal year of the producer or person.



### Specific Identification Method

**4** 

- **(1)** Except as otherwise provided under subsection (2), where the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the specific identification method, the producer or person shall physically segregate, in materials inventory, originating materials that are fungible materials from non-originating materials that are fungible materials.

- **(2)** Where originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials are marked with an origin identifier, the producer or person need not physically segregate those materials under subsection (1) if the origin identifier remains visible throughout the production of the good.



### Average Method

**5** Where the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the average method, the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory that is calculated under sections 6 and 7.


**6** 

- **(1)** The ratio is calculated with respect to a one-month or three-month period, at the choice of the producer or person, by dividing
	- **(a)** the sum of
		- **(i)** the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
		- **(ii)** the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period
by
	- **(b)** the sum of
		- **(i)** the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
		- **(ii)** the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were received in materials inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.

- **(2)** The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding one-month or three-month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory at the end of the preceding one-month or three-month period.


**7** 

- **(1)** Where the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the regional value content of that good is calculated under the transaction value method or the net cost method, the ratio is calculated with respect to each shipment of the good by dividing
	- **(a)** the total units of originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment
by
	- **(b)** the total units of originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that were in materials inventory prior to the shipment.

- **(2)** The ratio calculated with respect to a shipment of a good under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible materials remaining in materials inventory after the shipment.



### Manner of Dealing with Opening Inventory

**8** 

- **(1)** Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), where the producer or person referred to in section 3 has fungible materials in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible materials is determined by
	- **(a)** identifying, in the books of the producer or person, the latest receipts of fungible materials that add up to the amount of fungible materials in opening inventory;
	- **(b)** determining the origin of the fungible materials that make up those receipts; and
	- **(c)** considering the origin of those fungible materials to be the origin of the fungible materials in opening inventory.

- **(2)** Where the producer or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating materials or non-originating materials that are fungible materials and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible materials is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.

- **(3)** The producer or person may consider all fungible materials in opening inventory to be non-originating materials.



**PART 2** 
## Fungible Goods


### Interpretation

**9** The following definitions apply in this Part.

***average method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods inventory is based on the ratio, calculated under section 13, of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory. (*méthode de la moyenne*)

***FIFO method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible goods first received in finished goods inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible goods first withdrawn from finished goods inventory. (*méthode PEPS*)

***finished goods inventory*** means an inventory from which fungible goods are sold or otherwise transferred to another person. (*stock de produits finis*)

***LIFO method*** means the method by which the origin of fungible goods last received in finished goods inventory is considered to be the origin of fungible goods first withdrawn from finished goods inventory. (*méthode DEPS*)

***opening inventory*** means the finished goods inventory at the time an inventory management method is chosen. (*stock d’ouverture*)

***origin identifier*** means any mark that identifies fungible goods as originating goods or non-originating goods. (*identificateur d’origine*)



### General

**10** The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible goods referred to in paragraph 5(8)(b) of these Regulations are originating goods are the following:
- **(a)** specific identification method;
- **(b)** FIFO method;
- **(c)** LIFO method; and
- **(d)** average method.


**11** Where an exporter of a good or a person from whom the exporter acquired the good chooses an inventory management method referred to in section 10, that method, including the averaging period chosen in the case of the average method, shall be used from the time the choice is made until the end of the fiscal year of the exporter or person.



### Specific Identification Method

**12** 

- **(1)** Except as provided under subsection (2), where the exporter or person referred to in section 11 chooses the specific identification method, the exporter or person shall physically segregate, in finished goods inventory, originating goods that are fungible goods from non-originating goods that are fungible goods.

- **(2)** Where originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods are marked with an origin identifier, the exporter or person need not physically segregate those goods under subsection (1) if the origin identifier is visible on the fungible goods.



### Average Method

**13** 

- **(1)** Where the exporter or person referred to in section 11 chooses the average method, the origin of each shipment of fungible goods withdrawn from finished goods inventory during a one-month or three-month period, at the choice of the exporter or person, is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating goods and non-originating goods in finished goods inventory for the preceding one-month or three-month period that is calculated by dividing
	- **(a)** the sum of
		- **(i)** the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
		- **(ii)** the total units of originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period
by
	- **(b)** the sum of
		- **(i)** the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were in finished goods inventory at the beginning of the preceding one-month or three-month period, and
		- **(ii)** the total units of originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that were received in finished goods inventory during that preceding one-month or three-month period.

- **(2)** The ratio calculated with respect to a preceding one-month or three-month period under subsection (1) is applied to the fungible goods remaining in finished goods inventory at the end of the preceding one-month or three-month period.



### Manner of Dealing with Opening Inventory

**14** 

- **(1)** Except as otherwise provided under subsections (2) and (3), where the exporter or person referred to in section 11 has fungible goods in opening inventory, the origin of those fungible goods is determined by
	- **(a)** identifying, in the books of the exporter or person, the latest receipts of fungible goods that add up to the amount of fungible goods in opening inventory;
	- **(b)** determining the origin of the fungible goods that make up those receipts; and
	- **(c)** considering the origin of those fungible goods to be the origin of the fungible goods in opening inventory.

- **(2)** Where the exporter or person chooses the specific identification method and has, in opening inventory, originating goods or non-originating goods that are fungible goods and that are marked with an origin identifier, the origin of those fungible goods is determined on the basis of the origin identifier.

- **(3)** The exporter or person may consider all fungible goods in opening inventory to be non-originating goods.
