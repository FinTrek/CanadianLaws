### **SCHEDULE 5** 
**(Subsections 7(1) and (3) and paragraphs 15(1)(a) and (b) and 32(1)(c))**
## Environmental Effects Monitoring Studies

## Interpretation

**1** 

- **(1)** The following definitions apply in this Schedule.

***biological monitoring study*** means a study referred to in section 9. (*étude de suivi biologique*)

***effect on fish tissue from mercury*** means a concentration of total mercury that exceeds 0.5 μg/g wet weight in fish tissue that is taken in an exposure area and that is statistically different from and higher than the concentration of total mercury in fish tissue that is taken in a reference area. (*effet du mercure sur les tissus de poissons*)

***effect on the benthic invertebrate community*** means a statistical difference between data referred to in subparagraph 12(1)(e)(ii) and paragraph 12(1)(f) from a study respecting the benthic invertebrate community conducted in
- **(a)** an exposure area and a reference area; or
- **(b)** sampling areas within an exposure area where there are gradually decreasing effluent concentrations. (*effet sur la communauté d’invertébrés benthiques*)

***effect on the fish population*** means a statistical difference between data relating to the indicators referred to in subparagraph 12(1)(e)(i) from a study respecting fish population conducted in
- **(a)** an exposure area and a reference area; or
- **(b)** sampling areas within an exposure area where there are gradually decreasing effluent concentrations. (*effet sur la population de poissons*)

***exposure area*** means all fish habitat and waters frequented by fish that are exposed to effluent. (*zone exposée*)

***fish*** has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Act but does not include parts of fish, parts of shellfish, parts of crustaceans or parts of marine animals. (*poisson*)

***reference area*** means water frequented by fish that is not exposed to effluent and that has fish habitat that, as far as practicable, is most similar to that of the exposure area. (*zone de référence*)

***sampling area*** means the area within an exposure or reference area where representative samples are collected. (*zone d’échantillonnage*)

- **(2)** For the purpose of this schedule, ***critical effect size***, in relation to an effect indicator set out in column 1 of the following table, means the critical effect size set out in column 2:
