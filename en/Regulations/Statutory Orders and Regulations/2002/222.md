	- **(b)** an effluent containing any concentration of a deleterious substance that is set out in any of items 1 to 8 of Schedule 4, unless another law of the jurisdiction where the mine is located requires that the mine produce an effluent containing the deleterious substance in a concentration that is equal to or less than the limits set out in Schedule 4; and
	- **(c)** an effluent of any pH, unless another law of the jurisdiction where the mine is located requires that the mine produce an effluent with a pH equal to or greater than 6.0 but not greater than 9.5.

- **(2)** Despite paragraph (1)(a), the owner or operator may apply for a transitional authorization to deposit acutely lethal effluent only if the mine produced such an effluent at any time during the 12-month period preceding the application.

- **(3)** The owner or operator of a mine may apply to an authorization officer for a transitional authorization that permits only the deposit of an effluent containing any concentration of total suspended solids, but may not apply if another law of the jurisdiction where the mine is located requires that the mine produce an effluent containing total suspended solids in a concentration equal to or less than the limits set out in Schedule 4 or if, during the 12-month period preceding the application, the results of two consecutive effluent monitoring tests conducted under sections 12 to 16 indicate that
	- **(a)** the concentration in the effluent of any of the deleterious substances referred to in any of items 1 to 6 or 8 of Schedule 4 exceeded the applicable authorized limits set out in that Schedule;
	- **(b)** the pH of the effluent was less than 6.0 or greater than 9.5; or
	- **(c)** the effluent was acutely lethal.

- **(4)** The owner or operator referred to in subsection (1) shall submit an application for a transitional authorization not later than three months after these Regulations are registered and shall submit with the application,
	- **(a)** the information required by Part 1 of Schedule 7 including, for the 12-month period preceding the application
		- **(i)** the monthly mean concentrations of the deleterious substances set out in column 1 of Schedule 4 that are contained in the effluent,
		- **(ii)** whether the effluent is acutely lethal, and
		- **(iii)** the pH of the effluent;
	- **(b)** a description of the facilities and procedures that are necessary to deposit an effluent that complies with paragraphs 4(1)(a) to (c);
	- **(c)** a proposed schedule for the construction of the facilities and implementation of the procedures; and
	- **(d)** a signed statement of certification as set out in Part 2 of Schedule 7.

- **(5)** The owner or operator referred to in subsection (3) shall submit an application for a transitional authorization not earlier than 24 months and not later than 27 months after these Regulations are registered and shall submit with the application
	- **(a)** the information required by Part 1 of Schedule 7 including, for the 12-month period preceding the application,
		- **(i)** the monthly mean concentrations of the deleterious substances set out in column 1 of Schedule 4 that are contained in the effluent,
		- **(ii)** whether the effluent is acutely lethal, and
		- **(iii)** the pH of the effluent;
	- **(b)** a description of the facilities and procedures that are necessary to deposit an effluent that complies with the concentrations referred to in item 7 of Schedule 4;
	- **(c)** a proposed schedule for the construction of the facilities and implementation of the procedures;
	- **(d)** a signed statement of certification as set out in Part 2 of Schedule 7; and
	- **(e)** a statement of certification signed by the owner, the operator or their duly authorized representative indicating that there is no feasible alternative to the transitional authorization, based on documented engineering evidence.




### Issuance of Transitional Authorization


**35** 

- **(1)** An authorization officer shall issue to the owner or operator of a mine a transitional authorization, if
	- **(a)** the owner or operator is entitled to make the application under subsections 34(1) to (3) and has complied with subsection 34(4) or (5), as applicable; and
	- **(b)** any construction of facilities and the implementation of the procedures described by the owner or operator under paragraph 34(4)(b) or (5)(b), as applicable will result in the deposit of an effluent that complies with the requirements prescribed in paragraphs 4(1)(a) to (c).

- **(2)** The authorization officer shall issue a transitional authorization in the form set out in Schedule 8 and provide in the authorization
	- **(a)** for the deposit of acutely lethal effluent, the information required by Part 1 of Schedule 8; and
	- **(b)** for the deposit of effluent that contains a deleterious substance set out in column 1 of Schedule 4, the information required by Part 2 of Schedule 8, including the maximum concentration of the deleterious substances and the pH range of the effluent the determination of which are specified in that Schedule.

- **(3)** Authorization officers shall maintain a public record of all transitional authorizations issued for mines located in the province where they perform their functions.

	- **(b)** an acutely lethal effluent is being or has been deposited, unless the deposit of acutely lethal effluent is authorized in the transitional authorization.

- **(2)** The owner or operator shall provide to the inspector a written report of any test results which identified that the effluent contains a deleterious substance or is acutely lethal under subsection (1) within 30 days after the tests have been completed.




### Revocation of Transitional Authorizations

***effect on the benthic invertebrate community*** means a statistical difference between benthic invertebrate community measurements taken in an exposure area and a reference area or a statistical difference between measurements taken at sampling areas in the exposure area that indicate gradually decreasing effluent concentrations. (*effet sur la communauté d’invertébrés benthiques*)

***effect on the fish population*** means a statistical difference between fish population measurements taken in an exposure area and a reference area. (*effet sur la population de poissons*)

***exposure area*** means all fish habitat and waters frequented by fish that are exposed to effluent. (*zone exposée*)

***fish*** means fish as defined in section 2 of the [Fisheries Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-14.md) but does not include parts of fish, parts of shellfish, parts of crustaceans or parts of marine animals. (*poisson*)

***reference area*** means water frequented by fish that is not exposed to effluent and that has fish habitat that, as far as practicable, is most similar to that of the exposure area. (*zone de référence*)

***sampling area*** means the area within a reference or exposure area where representative samples are collected. (*zone d’échantillonnage*)
