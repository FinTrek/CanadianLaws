**8**

	- **(b)** an amount determined by a fraction of the annual amount of the discontinued pension
		- **(i)** the numerator of which is that number of years of service upon which the discontinued pension is based which, when added to number of years of service or pensionable services upon which the allowance is based, does not exceed in the aggregate thirty-five years, and

### Payments Otherwise than by Monthly Instalments


**44** Where a pensioner or a recipient of a pension requests that a pension be paid otherwise than in equal monthly instalments, or where the Minister is of opinion that the payment of a pension in equal monthly instalments is not practical, he may direct, if such direction does not result in the payment of an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate amount of equal monthly instalments otherwise payable in accordance with section 57 of the Act, that the pension shall be paid in arrears
