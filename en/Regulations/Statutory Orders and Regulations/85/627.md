## Direction


**3** The Commission is hereby directed that, on and after June 27, 1985, broadcasting licences may not be issued and renewals of broadcasting licences may not be granted to applicants of the following classes:
- **(a)** Her Majesty in right of any province;
- **(b)** agents of Her Majesty in right of any province; and
- **(c)** municipal governments.



**4** Where, in respect of an application for a broadcasting transmitting undertaking licence principally for the purpose of retransmission of programming or a broadcasting receiving undertaking licence, or a renewal thereof, applied for by an applicant of the class described in paragraph 3(c) or by any person that, in the opinion of the Commission, is controlled by a municipal government, the Commission is satisfied that
- **(a)** a substantial portion of the area served or sought to be served under the broadcasting licence is not served or to be served by a broadcasting receiving undertaking, other than an undertaking for which the applicant is the licensee, already authorized by the Commission,
- **(b)** a refusal to issue the broadcasting licence applied for or grant a renewal thereof would be contrary to the public interest, and
- **(c)** the community programming provided by the undertaking will provide a reasonable, balanced opportunity for the expression of differing views on matters of public concern,
the Commission may, notwithstanding section 3, issue a broadcasting transmitting undertaking licence principally for the purpose of retransmission of programming or a broadcasting receiving undertaking licence, or grant a renewal thereof.



**5** Nothing in this Direction shall be construed as limiting the power of the Governor in Council to direct that broadcasting licences may not be issued and amendments or renewals of broadcasting licences may not be granted to applicants of a class other than a class described in section 3 or as limiting the power of the Commission, in carrying out its objects, to refuse to issue a broadcasting licence or to grant an amendment or renewal of a broadcasting licence to an applicant of a class other than a class described in section 3.
