**5** For the purposes of sections 3 and 4, ***rate prevailing*** on a date means, in respect of a currency of any country other than Canada, the rate of exchange for that currency, as communicated to the ports of entry by the Minister for that date.



**6** Subject to sections 7 and 8, the rate of exchange for any currency to be communicated by the Minister to the ports of entry shall be established on the basis of
- **(a)** the latest rate of exchange for that currency quoted to the Minister by the Bank of Canada;

**7** Where more than one rate of exchange for a currency is quoted as described in paragraph 6(a), (b) or (c), excluding any rate of exchange for that currency commonly known as a tourist rate, the rate of exchange for that currency shall be established on the basis of the average of the exchange rates so quoted, excluding any tourist rate, weighted by the percentage value in terms of Canadian currency of all the goods in the same category as the goods in question that, according to the records of Statistics Canada, were imported from the country of export during the latest six month period for which such records are available prior to the establishment of that rate of exchange.



**8** Where no rate of exchange for a currency is quoted as described in paragraph 6(a), (b) or (c), the Minister shall establish a rate of exchange for that currency on the basis of the information available to him as to the value of that currency in Canadian currency.
