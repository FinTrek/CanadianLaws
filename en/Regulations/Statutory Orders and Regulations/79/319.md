## Information to Be Furnished


**3** A company that charges tolls shall, at the end of each three month period of operation, furnish to the Board
- **(a)** the rate of return on the rate base obtained for that period compared with the rates of return on the rate base authorized by the Board at the company’s most recent rate hearing or, in the case of a company whose rate of return on the rate base has not been authorized by the Board, the rate of return on equity for that period;
