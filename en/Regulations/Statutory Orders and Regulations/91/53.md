```

- **(b)** in any other case, the amount determined by the formula
```
A × 4.25%
```
where

- **(B)** in any other case, the fair market value of the complex at that time,
- **(iv)** where tax was deemed under subsection 336(3) of the Act to have been collected in respect of a supply of the complex and a rebate under subsection 121(3) of the Act is payable to the builder of the complex, the consideration for the supply, and
- **(v)** in the case of a complex that is a condominium unit, where tax was deemed under subsection 336(4) of the Act to have been collected in respect of a supply of the condominium complex in which the unit is situated and a rebate under subsection 121(3) of the Act is payable to the builder of the complex, the portion of the consideration for the supply that is attributable to that unit.
