## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Chlorobiphenyls Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** In these Regulations,

***chlorobiphenyls*** means the chlorobiphenyls described in item 1 of the List of Toxic Substances in Schedule 1 to the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md); (*biphényles chlorés*)

***electrical transformers*** includes any transformer-rectifier assembly installed in a common enclosure. (*transformateurélectrique*) 
> SOR/2000-102, s. 3.





## Prohibition


**3** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2) and section 4, no person shall manufacture, process, use, offer for sale or import chlorobiphenyls for any of the following commercial, manufacturing or processing uses:
	- **(a)** in the operation of any product, machinery or equipment other than
		- **(i)** electrical capacitors and electrical transformers and associated electrical equipment,
		- **(ii)** heat transfer equipment, hydraulic equipment, electromagnets, other than electromagnets referred to in paragraph (b), and vapour diffusion pumps that were designed to use chlorobiphenyls and that were in use in Canada on or before September 1, 1977, or
		- **(iii)** machinery or equipment for the destruction of chlorobiphenyls;
	- **(b)** in the operation of electromagnets that are used to handle food, animal feed or any additive to food or animal feed;
	- **(c)** as a constituent of any product, machinery or equipment manufactured in or imported into Canada on or after September 1, 1977, other than electrical capacitors and electrical transformers and associated electrical equipment;
	- **(d)** as a constituent of electrical capacitors and electrical transformers and associated electrical equipment manufactured in or imported into Canada on or after July 1, 1980;
	- **(e)** in the servicing or maintenance of any product, machinery or equipment other than electromagnets and electrical transformers and associated electrical equipment from which the chlorobiphenyls are removed to allow servicing and maintenance; or
	- **(f)** as new filling or as make-up fluid in the servicing or maintenance of any electromagnet, electrical transformer or associated electrical equipment.

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply when chlorobiphenyls are adventitiously present in any product, machinery or equipment and the quantity or concentration of chlorobiphenyls in the product, machinery or equipment is not inconsistent with good manufacturing practice.




## Concentration in Products


**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), the concentration of chlorobiphenyls that may be contained in any liquid in products, machinery or equipment referred to in subparagraphs 3(1)(a)(i) or (ii) that are manufactured, imported or offered for sale in Canada shall not exceed 50 parts per million by weight of the liquid.

- **(2)** The concentration permitted under subsection (1) does not apply in respect of concentrations of chlorobiphenyls in the liquid in any product, machinery or equipment referred to in subsection (1) where the product, machinery or equipment is
	- **(a)** offered for sale as a necessary and integral part of a building, plant or structure;
	- **(b)** imported for the destruction of the chlorobiphenyls contained in that product, machinery or equipment; or
	- **(c)** offered for sale for destruction or storage awaiting destruction of the chlorobiphenyls contained in that product.




## Concentrations or Quantities that May Be Released


**5** 

- **(1)** The concentration of chlorobiphenyls in any liquid that may be released into the environment, in the course of a commercial, manufacturing or processing activity in any geographical area of Canada, other than any water or place to which subsection 36(3) of the [Fisheries Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-14.md) applies, shall not exceed the concentration specified in subsection (2) in respect of that activity.

- **(2)** For the purpose of subsection (1), the concentration that may be released
	- **(a)** is 50 parts per million by weight of the liquid in respect of a commercial, manufacturing or processing activity other than
		- **(i)** an application to a road surface, or
		- **(ii)** an activity described in section 6; and
	- **(b)** is 5 parts per million by weight of the liquid in respect of an application to a road surface.
