***dry*** means a condition that does not include uncombined water vapour; (*à sec*)

***lead alloy*** means an alloy of lead that contains forty per cent or more of lead by weight; (*alliage de plomb*)

***normal cubic metre*** or ***norm. m<sup>3</sup>*** means, in respect of a gas, the quantity of gas occupying a volume of one cubic metre at 25°C and at a pressure of 760 mm of mercury; (*mètre cube normal* or *m<sup>3</sup> norm*)

***particulate matter*** means particulate matter containing lead or lead in combination with any other substance; (*particules*)

***reverberatory furnace*** includes a stationary, rotating or rocking and tilting furnace; (*four à réverbère*)

***secondary lead smelter*** means any plant or factory in which lead-bearing scrap or lead-bearing materials, other than lead-bearing concentrates derived from a mining operation, are processed by metallurgical or chemical process into refined lead, lead alloys or lead oxide; (*fonderie de plomb de seconde fusion*)

***undiluted*** means a condition that does not include air or other gases in excess of the quantity necessary for processing requirements at a secondary lead smelter. (*non dilué*)




## Release of Lead


**3** The concentration of particulate matter that the owner or operator of a secondary lead smelter releases into the ambient air shall not exceed
- **(a)** 0.046 grams per normal cubic metre, in the case of operations involving the use of blast furnaces, cupolas or reverberatory furnaces, and
- **(b)** 0.023 grams per normal cubic metre, in the case of operations involving the use of holding furnaces, kettle furnaces or lead oxide production units or involving scrap handling and material handling, crushing, furnace tapping, furnace slagging, furnace cleaning or casting, whether released separately or in combination with releases from other sources,
measured dry and undiluted in accordance with the method described in Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Particulate Matter and Lead from Secondary Lead Smelters, Department of the Environment Report EPS-1-AP-78-3 dated June 1979, as amended from time to time.
> SOR/94-364, s. 2(F).




**4** Subject to section 5, the concentration of lead in particulate matter that the owner or operator of a secondary lead smelter releases into the ambient air from the operations referred to in paragraphs 3(a) and (b) shall not exceed sixty-three per cent by weight of the particulate matter measured by the method described in Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Particulate Matter and Lead from Secondary Lead Smelters, Department of the Environment Report EPS-1-AP-78-3 dated June 1979, as amended from time to time.



**5** The concentration of lead in particulate matter that is released from the operations referred to in paragraphs 3(a) and (b) may exceed sixty-three per cent by weight of the particulate matter where the quantity of that particulate matter released from those operations is reduced so that the quantity of lead released is equivalent to sixty-three per cent by weight of a particulate matter release of
- **(a)** 0.046 grams per normal cubic metre, in the case of the operations referred to in paragraph 3(a); or
- **(b)** 0.023 grams per normal cubic metre, in the case of the operations referred to in paragraph 3(b).



**6** No particulate matter shall be released into the ambient air from the storage of lead-bearing scrap or lead-bearing material in or about a secondary lead smelter, other than as a result of handling.




## Malfunction or Breakdown


**7** Notwithstanding sections 3 and 4, the concentrations of particulate matter and of lead in particulate matter set out in those sections may be exceeded in the event of a malfunction or breakdown in the air pollution control equipment or the process equipment associated with the operations referred to in section 3 where the time during which the release standards are exceeded does not exceed
- **(a)** in respect of a cupola or blast furnace, a total of two hours per month;
- **(b)** in respect of a reverberatory furnace, a total of one hour per month; and
- **(c)** in respect of a holding furnace, kettle furnace or lead oxide production unit,
	- **(i)** 15 minutes for a single malfunction or breakdown, and
	- **(ii)** a total of one hour per month.




## Information and Samples


**8** The Minister may request the owner or operator of a secondary lead smelter to submit to the Minister information and samples respecting the operation of the smelter or the malfunction or breakdown of its air pollution equipment or process equipment.




## Release Measurement Reports


**9** 

- **(1)** Where, pursuant to section 8, the Minister requests information respecting the operation of a secondary lead smelter, the owner or operator of the smelter shall submit to the Minister a duly completed Release Measurement Report in the form set out in Schedule I.

- **(2)** The report referred to in subsection (1) shall contain information that is obtained from release measurements and subsequent analysis of samples taken from the appropriate sources at the secondary lead smelter during the sixty days preceding the date on which the report is required to be submitted to the Minister pursuant to subsection (3).

- **(3)** The report referred to in subsection (1) shall be submitted to the Minister
	- **(a)** in respect of the operations referred to in paragraph 3(a), at intervals of six months, and
	- **(b)** in respect of the operations referred to in paragraph 3(b), at intervals of twelve months,
the intervals to commence three months after the request is made by the Minister.

- **(4)** For the purposes of subsection (2), at the request of the Minister, release measurements shall be carried out in the presence of an enforcement officer.

- **(5)** The analysis referred to in subsection (2) shall be carried out in accordance with the appropriate methods described in sections 3 and 4 and all samples shall be taken
	- **(a)** during normal operating conditions of the secondary lead smelter; and
	- **(b)** in the case of furnace operation sampling, during representative periods of furnace operation including charging and tapping.
> SOR/94-364, s. 2(E); SOR/2000-102, s. 4.




**10** The release measurements referred to in section 9 shall consist of at least three valid test runs and the release measurement result shall be the arithmetic average of the results of these valid test runs.



**11** For the purposes of section 10, a ***valid test run*** means a release measurement
- **(a)** the result of which does not vary by more than twenty-five per cent from the arithmetic average of the results of all release measurements made for the tested operation; and
- **(b)** that is made using a sample taken over a minimum continuous operating period of 120 minutes.



**12** Where the detailed calculations of the test data set out in the report referred to in subsection 9(1) are not appended to the report, the owner or operator of a secondary lead smelter shall, within thirty days after submitting the report, submit those detailed calculations in writing to the Minister.




## Malfunction or Breakdown Reports


**13** Where, pursuant to section 8, the Minister requests information respecting a malfunction or breakdown in the air pollution control equipment or the process equipment associated with the operations referred to in section 3, the owner or operator of the secondary lead smelter shall submit to the Minister a duly completed Malfunction or Breakdown Report in the form set out in Schedule II on a monthly basis commencing two months after the request is made by the Minister.
> SOR/94-364, s. 2(E).





## Signing of Reports

## Submission of Samples and Related Information


**15** 

- **(1)** Where, pursuant to section 8, the Minister requests samples of gas streams released into the ambient air from a secondary lead smelter and such related information as will enable the Minister to cause analysis to be made of the concentration of particulate matter in those gas streams, the owner or operator of the secondary lead smelter shall take the samples at six month intervals, in accordance with the method described in Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Particulate Matter and Lead from Secondary Lead Smelters, Department of the Environment Report EPS-1-AP-78-3 dated June 1979, as amended from time to time and shall forthwith submit the samples and related information to the Minister.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), at the request of the Minister, the samples shall be taken in the presence of an enforcement officer.
