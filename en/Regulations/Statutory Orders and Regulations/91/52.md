- **(i)** where the class of goods is gasoline or diesel fuel, the number of litres of gasoline or diesel fuel, as the case may be, that form part of the inventory,
- **(ii)** where the class of goods is software products, the total value of the computer carrier media, excluding the value of instructions or data stored thereon, that form part of the inventory or the product obtained when $5 is multiplied by the number of those computer carrier media, and
- **(iii)** in any other case, the total value of goods in the class (other than used goods) that form part of that inventory, as that total value would be required to be determined at the beginning of January 1, 1991 for the purpose of computing the person’s income from a business for the purposes of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md); or
- **(b)** where the person elects to use the following formula and where

	- **(ii)** the aggregate of
		- **(A)** the total value of the person’s inventory (other than gasoline, diesel fuel and used goods) at that time, and
		- **(B)** the total value of goods (other than gasoline, diesel fuel and used goods) that would be inventory of the person at that time if the goods were tax-paid goods,each of which is determined as of that time in accordance with the method that the person would be required to use for purposes of computing the person’s income from a business for purposes of the [Income Tax Act](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%201%20(5th%20Supp.).md), does not exceed $70,000,

```
A + B + C
```
where
- **A** is the product obtained by multiplying the number of litres of gasoline that form part of the person’s inventory at that time by the prescribed tax factor in respect of gasoline;
- **B** is the product obtained by multiplying the number of litres of diesel fuel that form part of the person’s inventory at that time by the prescribed tax factor in respect of diesel fuel; and
