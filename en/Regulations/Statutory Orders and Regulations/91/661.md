- **(c)** that is manufactured before the date set out in column 2 of an item of Part 2 of the schedule shall, in the body of water described in column 1 of that item, comply with these Regulations as of the date set out in column 3 of that item.
> SOR/2000-216, s. 1.





## Sewage Disposal


**5** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), no pleasure craft shall discharge sewage into any body of water described in the schedule and no person shall discharge or permit the discharge of sewage from a pleasure craft into any of those bodies of water.

- **(2)** For the purposes of Part XV of the Act, sewage may be discharged from a pleasure craft into any body of water if the discharge
	- **(a)** is to ensure the safety of the craft or any person on board; or
	- **(b)** results from damage to the craft or its equipment and all reasonable precautions are taken by the persons on board the craft after the occurrence of the damage to prevent or minimize the discharge.

- **(3)** A pleasure craft that is fitted with a toilet shall be fitted with a holding tank.

- **(4)** Subject to subsection (5), a pleasure craft may be fitted with a piping system that allows the discharge of sewage directly
	- **(a)** from a toilet into a holding tank;
	- **(b)** from a toilet overboard by bypassing the holding tank; or

- **(5)** Where a pleasure craft is fitted with a piping system referred to in paragraph (4)(b) or (c) and is in a body of water described in the schedule, the system shall be visibly disconnected and closed so as to prevent the possible discharge of sewage from the craft.
> SOR/94-374, s. 4.





## Holding Tank


**6** Where a pleasure craft is fitted with a holding tank, the tank shall
- **(a)** be an integral part of the hull structure of the pleasure craft or be securely attached to the hull;
- **(b)** be constructed of structurally sound material that prevents the tank contents from leaking;
- **(c)** be resistant to corrosion by sewage;
- **(d)** have an adequate capacity for the craft’s normal complement;
- **(e)** be provided with a discharge connection and a piping system for the removal of the tank contents by a pumping facility;
- **(f)** be designed so that the level of sewage in the tank may be determined without the tank being opened and without contacting or removing any of the tank contents, or be equipped with a device that allows that determination to be made; and
- **(g)** be equipped with a ventilation device that
	- **(i)** has its vent outlet located on the outside of the pleasure craft and in a safe location,
	- **(ii)** prevents the build-up within the tank of pressure that could cause damage to the tank,
	- **(iii)** is constructed of material that cannot be corroded by sewage, and
