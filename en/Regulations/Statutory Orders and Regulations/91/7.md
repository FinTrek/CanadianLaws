## Calculation of Cost Recovery Charges


**14**

```
A x B/C
```
 where
- **A** is the total amount of costs determined in accordance with subsection 13(1);
- **B** is the forecast of deliveries, in cubic metres, of that company for the following year provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(a); and
- **C** is the aggregate of the forecasts of deliveries, in cubic metres, for the following year, of all the large oil pipeline companies, provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(a).

- **(2)** The cost recovery charge payable by a large gas pipeline company is equal to the amount determined by the formula
```
A x B/C
```

- **A** is the total amount of costs determined in accordance with subsection 13(2);
- **B** is the forecast of deliveries, in cubic metres, of that company for the following year provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(a); and
- **C** is the aggregate of the forecasts of deliveries, in cubic metres, for the following year, of all the large gas pipeline companies, provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(a).

- **(3)** The cost recovery charge payable by a large electricity exporter is the greater of $500 and the amount determined by the formula
```
A x (B+C)/(D+E)
```
 where
- **A** is the total amount of costs determined in accordance with subsection 13(3);
- **B** is the aggregate of the actual or estimated firm and interruptible sale transfers and equichange transfers of electricity as determined by the Board from its export database, in megawatt hours, of that exporter for the current year and the two preceding years;
- **C** is the forecast, in megawatt hours, of the firm and interruptible sale transfer of electricity of that exporter for the year following the current year provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(b);
- **D** is the aggregate of the actual or estimated firm and interruptible sale transfers and equichange transfers of electricity as determined by the Board from its export database, in megawatt hours, of all the large electricity exporters for the current year and the two preceding years; and
- **E** is the aggregate of the forecasts, in megawatt hours, of the firm and interruptible sale transfers of electricity of all the large electricity exporters for the year following the current year provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(b).

- **(4)** For the purpose of calculating the actual firm and interruptible sale transfers and equichange transfers referred to in the descriptions of B and D in subsection (3), any exports of firm or interruptible energy that are made pursuant to an equichange export contract shall be adjusted from time to time by the Board, by subtracting the quantity of energy imported into Canada from the quantity of energy exported from Canada pursuant to that contract.
> SOR/98-267, s. 7.




**14.1** 

- **(1)** If one or more large oil pipeline companies is relieved under section 4.1 from paying a portion of the cost recovery charge in respect of the following year, the cost recovery charge in respect of that year shall be reduced or increased as follows:

	- **(b)** for each large oil pipeline company that does not obtain relief, the cost recovery charge shall be increased by the amount determined by the formula
```
A × B/C
```
where, in respect of that year,
- **A** is the total amount of relief obtained by large oil pipeline companies under section 4.1,
- **B** is the forecast of deliveries, in cubic metres, of the company, provided to the Board pursuant to paragraph 10(1)(a), and

	- **(b)** for each large gas pipeline company that does not obtain relief, the cost recovery charge shall be increased by the amount determined by the formula
```
A × B/C
```
