where
- **S** is the supplementary royalty in dollars,
- **T** is the amount of oil, in cubic metres, that is obtained from, or attributable to, each well in a contract area during a month,

### Gas Royalty

**2** 

- **(1)** Where gas that is obtained from, or attributable to, a lease area is sold, the royalty payable is the gross royalty value of the gas, determined pursuant to subsection (2), less the portion of the cost of gathering, dehydrating, compressing and processing the gas that is equal to its gross royalty value divided by its total value.

- **(2)** The gross royalty value of gas that is obtained from or attributable to a lease area is the basic gross royalty value of 25 per cent of the quantity of that gas multiplied by the actual selling price plus a supplementary gross royalty value determined pursuant to subsection (3), calculated at the time and place of production.

- **(3)** The supplementary gross royalty value on gas referred to in subsection (2), individually determined for each gas component produced, is equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying 75 per cent of the quantity of each gas component by
	- **(a)** in the case of marketable gas,
		- **(i)** if the actual selling price exceeds $10.65/10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> but does not exceed $24.85/10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, 30 per cent of the difference between the actual selling price per 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> and $10.65/10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, or
		- **(ii)** if the actual selling price exceeds $24.85/10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, $4.26/10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> plus 55 per cent of the portion of the actual selling price in excess of $24.85/10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>;
	- **(b)** in the case of pentanes plus, if the actual selling price exceeds $27.68 per cubic metre, 50 per cent of the portion of the actual selling price in excess of $27.68 per cubic metre;
	- **(c)** in the case of sulphur, if the actual selling price exceeds $39.37 per tonne, 50 per cent of the portion of the actual selling price in excess of $39.37 per tonne;
	- **(d)** in the case of other components from a source that produces marketable gas, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the actual selling price of each of those components by the percentage by which the overall royalty rate for marketable gas, taking both basic and supplementary gross royalties values into account, exceeds 25 per cent; and
	- **(e)** in the case of other components from a source that does not produce marketable gas, the lesser of one third of the actual selling price of that component and the amount determined under any special agreement entered into under subsection 4(2) of the Act.

- **(4)** For the purposes of this section, volumes referred to are volumes measured at standard conditions of 101.325 kPa and 15°C.

- **(5)** The Executive Director shall advise the band council of any costs that are deducted under subsection (1) for gathering, dehydrating, compressing and processing.



### Royalty on Oil or Gas Consumed

**3** 

- **(1)** Notwithstanding sections 1 and 2 and subject to subsection (2), the royalty payable on oil or gas obtained from, or attributable to, a lease area that is consumed in the drilling for, or the production or processing of, oil or gas obtained from, or attributable to, that lease area is nil.

- **(2)** Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of oil or gas that is consumed for the production or processing of crude bitumen.



### Interpretation

**4** For the purposes of sections 1 and 2, ***actual selling price*** means the greater of
- **(a)** in respect of
	- **(i)** oil, the price at which the oil is sold, and
	- **(ii)** gas, the price or other consideration payable that is specified in the gas sales contract under which the gas is sold, free of any fees or deductions other than transmission charges beyond the facility outlet; and
- **(b)** the fair market value of the oil or gas, determined pursuant to subsection 33(6) of these Regulations.
