***airport*** means the Halifax International Airport, in the County of Halifax, Province of Nova Scotia; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surfaces*** means the imaginary inclined planes that extend upward and outward from each end of a strip, which planes are more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surfaces d’approche*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary plane located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which plane is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which portion is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surfaces*** means the imaginary inclined planes that extend upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which planes are more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surfaces de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 133 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all land, including public road allowances, that is adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which land is more particularly described as follows:
- **(a)** the land within the outer limit described in Part VI of the schedule; and
- **(b)** the land directly under those portions of the approach surfaces that extend beyond the said outer limit.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct, on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Aeronautical Facilities


**5** No owner or lessee of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit any part of that land to be used or developed in a manner that causes interference with any signals or communications to and from any aircraft or to and from any facilities used to provide services relating to aeronautics.




## Natural Growth


**6** Where an object of natural growth that is on any land to which these Regulations apply grows to a height that exceeds in elevation at the location of the object any of the surfaces referred to in section 4, the Minister may require that the owner or lessee of the land remove the excessive growth.




## Disposal of Waste


**7** No owner or lessee of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit any part of that land to be used for the disposal of any waste that is edible by or attractive to birds.

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, shown on Halifax International Airport Zoning Plan No. S-2449-24 dated March 30, 1990, is determined by measuring 1 372 m northeasterly along the centre line of runway 06-24 from the southwesterly end of runway 06 and thence measuring 122 m southeasterly at right angles from the said centre line.


The said airport reference point has Nova Scotia Grid Coordinates of N 4 971 371.71 m and E 5 577 972.20 m.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

**(a)** an inclined plane abutting the end of the strip associated with the approach to runway 06 having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip;
