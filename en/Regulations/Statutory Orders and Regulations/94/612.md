## Charging


**18** Where an amount has been transferred pursuant to section 8 of the Act, that amount shall be charged to the account from which the member’s pension benefits are or will become payable.




## Adjustment


**19** 

- **(1)** In this Part, ***division factor*** is 0.5, except that
	- **(a)** where the amount transferred is a lump sum amount referred to in subsection 8(4) of the Act, the division factor is equal to the product of
```
((A) ÷ (B)) × 0.5
```
where
- **A** is the amount determined under subsection 8(4) of the Act, and
- **B** is the amount determined under these Regulations that, but for subsection 8(4) of the Act, would have been transferred pursuant to paragraph 8(1)(a) of the Act; and
	- **(b)** where the member was not vested at valuation day and is entitled to a pension under the member’s pension plan on the day the pension benefits are adjusted, the division factor is equal to the product of

((C) ÷ (D)) × 0.5
```
where
- **C** is the amount transferred under paragraph 8(1)(a) of the Act, and
- **D** is the amount that, but for subsection 8(4) of the Act, would have been transferred pursuant to paragraph 8(1)(a) of the Act had the member been vested on valuation day.

	- **(a)** an amount equal to the member’s reduction, in respect of any period during which the member is not a recipient; and

	- **(a)** the first day of the month after valuation day; and

**22** Notwithstanding section 21, where a transfer has been effected pursuant to paragraph 8(1)(a) of the Act and the member is entitled to
- **(a)** a pension by reason of disability, the reduction of the pension benefits shall begin on the first day of the month following the month during which the member would first be entitled to receive a pension that would not be reduced on account of age;
- **(b)** a pension that is reduced on account of age before or after becoming entitled to a pension by reason of disability, the reduction of the pension benefits shall be determined as if the member were not entitled to a pension by reason of disability; or

**23** The return of contributions or the cash termination allowance to which a member is entitled under the member’s pension plan shall be reduced by the product of
- **(a)** the return of contributions the member would have been entitled to receive in respect of the period subject to division, determined in the case of a member who is entitled to a cash termination allowance as if the member were entitled to a return of contributions, had there not been a transfer of the member’s pension benefits pursuant to paragraph 8(1)(a) of the Act; and
- **(b)** the division factor.



**23.1**

- **(2)** The actuarial present value shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology and assumptions set out in the agreement.

**25** Despite any provision of a pension plan, if a division of the pension benefits that have accrued to a member under that pension plan in respect of any period of pensionable service has been effected, the spouse, former spouse or former common-law partner in whose favour the division is effected ceases to be entitled to any pension to which he or she would have been entitled as a surviving spouse or surviving common-law partner in respect of that period of service.
