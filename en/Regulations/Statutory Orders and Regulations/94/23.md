*For the purposes of this Chapter, a chemical reaction is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.*

**Note 2:** *For the purposes of heading 27.10, the country of origin of a good shall be the country in which the good underwent either of the following processes:*

**(a)** *Atmospheric distillation – A separation process in which petroleum oils are converted in a distillation tower into fractions according to boiling point and the vapour then condensed into different liquefied fractions. Liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, diesel or heating oil, light gas oils and lubricating oil are produced from petroleum distillation; or*



**(b)** *Vacuum distillation – Distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so low that it would be classed as molecular distillation. Vacuum distillation is useful for distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as heavy distillates in petroleum oils to produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and residuum. In some refineries gas oils may be further processed into lubricating oils.*



**Note 3:** *For the purposes of heading 27.10, the country of origin of a good shall be the country in which the good underwent direct blending.*

***Direct blending*** is defined as a refinery process whereby various petroleum streams from processing units and petroleum components from holding or storage tanks combine to create a finished product, with pre-determined parameters, of heading 27.10, provided that the non-originating materials constitute no more than 25 per cent by volume of the good.
