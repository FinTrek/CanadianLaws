**20** A carrier holding corporation may refuse to accept any subscription for, issue, register the transfer of, purchase or otherwise acquire, any of its voting shares unless a declaration is submitted to the carrier holding corporation and the carrier holding corporation determines that the effect of the information appearing on the declaration, together with any other information in any books or records of the carrier holding corporation, or the Canadian carrier or either of their transfer agents or registrars is that the subscription, issue, transfer, purchase or acquisition would not result in
- **(a)** the percentage of the total voting shares of the carrier holding corporation that are beneficially owned and controlled by non-Canadians exceeding 33 1/3 per cent, in the case of a qualified corporation; or
- **(b)** the percentage of the total voting shares in the acquiring corporation that are beneficially owned and controlled by non-Canadians exceeding the percentage of voting shares in the carrier that were beneficially owned and controlled by non-Canadians as at July 22, 1987.

	- **(b)** where the shares are held by an intermediary or a depository, the date of registration of the transfer of the voting shares on its books or records.

	- **(a)** informing the registered holder of the board’s determination;
	- **(b)** confirming that the shares are to be sold by the date specified in the notification; and
