## Examination for Discovery



### General


**92** An examination for discovery may take the form of an oral examination or, at the option of the examining party, an examination by written questions and answers, but the examining party is not entitled to subject a person to both forms of examination except with leave of the Court.




### Who May be Examined


**93** 

- **(1)** A party to a proceeding may examine for discovery an adverse party once, and may examine that party more than once only with leave of the Court.

- **(2)** A party to be examined, other than an individual or the Crown, shall select a knowledgeable current or former officer, director, member or employee, to be examined on behalf of that party, but, if the examining party is not satisfied with that person, the examining party may apply to the Court to name some other person.

- **(3)** The Crown, when it is the party to be examined, shall select a knowledgeable current or former officer, servant or employee, nominated by the Deputy Attorney General of Canada, to be examined on behalf of that party, but, if the examining party is not satisfied with that person, the examining party may apply to the Court to name some other person.

- **(4)** If a current or former officer, director or employee of a corporation or of the Crown has been examined, no other person may be examined without leave of the Court.

- **(5)** Where an appeal is brought by a party under disability,
	- **(a)** the tutor, curator, litigation guardian or committee may be examined in place of the person under disability, or
	- **(b)** at the option of the examining party, the person under disability may be examined if that person is competent to give evidence,
but where any person, mentioned in paragraph (a), is a public official, that person may be examined only with leave of the Court.

- **(8)** Where a party is entitled to examine for discovery,
	- **(a)** more than one person under this section, or
	- **(b)** multiple parties who are in the same interest,
but the Court is satisfied that multiple examinations would be oppressive, vexatious or unnecessary, the Court may impose such limits on the right of discovery as are just.
> SOR/2007-142, s. 11.





### When May Examination be Held


**94** 

- **(1)** A party who seeks to examine an appellant for discovery may serve a notice to attend under section 103 or a list of written questions under section 113 only after the reply has been filed and served and, unless the parties agree otherwise, a list of documents under section 81 or 82 has been filed and served.

- **(2)** However, where it appears to the Court that it would be just to allow a party to examine an appellant for discovery other than in accordance with subsection (1) it may so direct.

- **(3)** A party who seeks to examine a respondent for discovery may serve a notice to attend under section 103 or a list of written questions under section 113 only after the respondent has delivered a reply or where the time to do so has expired and, unless the parties agree otherwise, after the examining party has served a list of documents under section 81 or 82.
> SOR/2007-142, s. 12.





### Scope of Examination


**95** 

- **(1)** A person examined for discovery shall answer, to the best of that person’s knowledge, information and belief, any proper question relating to any matter in issue in the proceeding or to any matter made discoverable by subsection (3) and no question may be objected to on the ground that,
	- **(a)** the information sought is evidence or hearsay,
	- **(b)** the question constitutes cross-examination, unless the question is directed solely to the credibility of the witness, or
	- **(c)** the question constitutes cross-examination on the affidavit of documents of the party being examined.

- **(2)** Prior to the examination for discovery, the person to be examined shall make all reasonable inquiries regarding the matters in issue from all of the party’s officers, servants, agents and employees, past or present, either within or outside Canada and, if necessary, the person being examined for discovery may be required to become better informed and for that purpose the examination may be adjourned.

- **(3)** A party may on an examination for discovery obtain disclosure of the findings, opinions and conclusions of an expert engaged by or on behalf of the party being examined that relate to a matter in issue in the proceeding including the expert’s name and address, but the party being examined need not disclose the information or the name and address of the expert where,
	- **(a)** the findings, opinions and conclusions of the expert relating to any matter in issue in the appeal were made or formed in preparation for contemplated or pending litigation and for no other purpose, and
	- **(b)** the party being examined undertakes not to call the expert as a witness at the hearing.

- **(4)** A party may on an examination for discovery obtain disclosure of the names and addresses of persons who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue in the proceeding, unless the Court orders otherwise.

### Effect of Refusal


**96** 

- **(1)** Where a party, or a person examined for discovery on behalf or in place of a party, has refused to answer a proper question or to answer a question on the ground of privilege, and has failed to furnish the information in writing not later than ten days after the proceeding is set down for hearing, the party may not introduce at the hearing the information refused on discovery, except with leave of the judge.

- **(2)** The sanction provided by subsection (1) is in addition to the sanctions provided by section 110.




### Effect of Counsel Answering


**97** Questions on an oral examination for discovery shall be answered by the person being examined but, where there is no objection, the question may be answered by counsel and the answer shall be deemed to be the answer of the person being examined unless, before the conclusion of the examination, the person repudiates, contradicts or qualifies the answer.




### Information Subsequently Obtained


**98** 

- **(1)** Where a party has been examined for discovery or a person has been examined for discovery on behalf or in place of, or in addition to the party, and the party subsequently discovers that the answer to a question on the examination,
	- **(a)** was incorrect or incomplete when made, or
	- **(b)** is no longer correct and complete,
the party shall forthwith provide the information in writing to every other party.

- **(2)** Where a party provides information in writing under subsection (1),
	- **(a)** the adverse party may require that the information be verified by affidavit of the party or be the subject of further examination for discovery, and
	- **(b)** the writing may be treated at a hearing as if it formed part of the original examination of the person examined.

- **(3)** Where a party has failed to comply with subsection (1) or a requirement under paragraph (2)(a), and the information subsequently discovered is,
	- **(a)** favourable to that party’s case, the party may not introduce the information at the hearing, except with leave of the judge, or
	- **(b)** not favourable to that party’s case, the Court may give such direction as is just.




### Discovery of Non-Parties with Leave


**99** 

- **(1)** The Court may grant leave, on such terms respecting costs and other matters as are just, to examine for discovery any person who there is reason to believe has information relevant to a material issue in the appeal, other than an expert engaged by or on behalf of a party in preparation for contemplated or pending litigation.

- **(2)** Leave under subsection (1) shall not be granted unless the Court is satisfied that,
	- **(a)** the moving party has been unable to obtain the information from other persons whom the moving party is entitled to examine for discovery, or from the person sought to be examined,
	- **(b)** it would be unfair to require the moving party to proceed to hearing without having the opportunity of examining the person, and
	- **(c)** the examination will not,
		- **(i)** unduly delay the commencement of the hearing of the proceeding,
		- **(ii)** entail unreasonable expense for other parties, or
		- **(iii)** result in unfairness to the person the moving party seeks to examine.

- **(3)** A party who examines a person orally under this section shall, if requested, serve any party who attended or was represented on the examination with the transcript free of charge, unless the Court directs otherwise.

	- **(b)** a person examined for discovery on behalf of or in place of, or in addition to the adverse party, unless the judge directs otherwise,

- **(2)** Subject to the provisions of the [Canada Evidence Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/C/C-5.md), the evidence given on an examination for discovery may be used for the purpose of impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness in the same manner as any previous inconsistent statement by that witness.

- **(3)** Where only part of the evidence given on an examination for discovery is read into or used in evidence, at the request of an adverse party the judge may direct the introduction of any other part of the evidence that qualifies or explains the part first introduced.

- **(3.1)** A party who seeks to read into evidence under subsection (1) or who requests the judge to direct the introduction of evidence under subsection (3) may, with leave of the judge, instead of reading into evidence, file with the Court a photocopy or other copy of the relevant extracts from the transcripts of the examination for discovery, and when the copy is filed such extracts shall form part of the record.

- **(4)** A party who reads into evidence as part of that party’s own case evidence given on an examination for discovery of an adverse party, or a person examined for discovery on behalf of or in place of or in addition to an adverse party, may rebut that evidence by introducing any other admissible evidence.

	- **(c)** for any other sufficient reason cannot be compelled to attend at the hearing, or
	- **(d)** refuses to take an oath or make an affirmation or to answer any proper question,
any party may, with leave of the judge, read into evidence all or part of the evidence given on the examination for discovery as the evidence of the person examined, to the extent that it would be admissible if the person were testifying in Court.

- **(7)** In deciding whether to grant leave under subsection (6), the judge shall consider,
	- **(a)** the extent to which the person was cross-examined on the examination for discovery,
	- **(b)** the importance of the evidence in the proceeding,
	- **(c)** the general principle that evidence should be presented orally in Court, and
	- **(d)** any other relevant factor.

- **(8)** Where an appeal has been discontinued or dismissed and another appeal involving the same subject matter is subsequently brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, the evidence given on an examination for discovery taken in the former appeal may be read into or used in evidence at the hearing of the subsequent appeal as if it had been taken in the subsequent appeal.
