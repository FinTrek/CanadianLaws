### **SCHEDULE II** 
**(Sections 2, 5 and 6)**
## Procedures for Testing Tents

### General

**1** A flame test of a specimen shall be performed

**(a)** under the standard atmospheric conditions specified in subsection 5.1.1 of CPAI-84, or immediately upon the removal of the specimen from such conditions; and



**(b)** when the specimen is in moisture equilibrium, within the meaning of subsection 5.1.2 of CPAI-84.





### Test of Flooring Material

**2** The method to be followed in measuring the damage displayed by specimens of a sample unit of flooring material is as follows:

**(a)** from the flooring material of the product to be tested, cut 12 specimens that meet the requirements set out in subsection 6.1 of CPAI-84;



**(b)** divide the specimens into three sample units, ensuring that, where the flooring material is woven, none of the specimens within a sample unit contains the same warp, weft yarns or filaments as any other specimen in that sample unit;



**(c)** prepare one sample unit in accordance with the leaching requirements set out in subsections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of CPAI-84;



**(d)** prepare a second sample unit in accordance with the accelerated weathering requirements set out in subsections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of CPAI-84;



**(e)** test the three sample units in accordance with the flame test method set out in section 6 of CPAI-84; and



**(f)** record, for each specimen, the shortest distance between the damaged area and the edge of the hole in the flattening frame.





### Test of Wall and Top Material

**3** The method to be followed in measuring the after-flame time, the average after-flame time, the damaged length and the average damage length of specimens of a sample unit of wall and top material is as follows:

**(a)** from the wall and top material of the product to be tested, cut 24 specimens that meet the requirements for test specimens set out in subsection 7.1 of CPAI-84;



**(b)** divide the specimens into three sample units, ensuring that, where the wall and top material is woven, each sample unit contains four specimens from the warp direction and four specimens from the weft direction of the wall and top material and that none of the specimens from the warp direction contains the same warp yarns or filaments as any other specimen from the warp direction and none of the specimens from the weft direction contains the same weft yarns or filaments as any other specimen from the weft direction;



**(c)** condition the specimens according to the procedures set out in subsections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 of CPAI-84;



**(d)** determine the mass per unit area of the specimens to the nearest g/m<sup>2</sup>;



**(e)** prepare one sample unit in accordance with the leaching requirements set out in subsections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of CPAI-84;



**(f)** prepare a second sample unit in accordance with the accelerated weathering requirements set out in subsections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of CPAI-84;



**(g)** test the three sample units in accordance with the flame test method set out in section 7 of CPAI-84, except that the loads for determining the damaged length set out in subsection 7.3.6.1 of CPAI-84 shall be replaced by the following:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Mass per Unit Area of Specimen Being Tested (g/m<sup>2</sup>)</th>
<th>Loads for Determining Damaged Length (g)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100 or less</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101 to 200</td>
<td>100</td>

</tr>
</table>




**(h)** record

**(i)** the after-flame time of each specimen,



**(ii)** the average after-flame time of the specimens of each sample unit,



**(iii)** the damaged length of each specimen,



**(iv)** the average damaged length of the specimens of each sample unit, and



**(v)** the presence of any portions that break, or any residues that drip, from a specimen and that continue to flame after reaching the floor of the test cabinet.
