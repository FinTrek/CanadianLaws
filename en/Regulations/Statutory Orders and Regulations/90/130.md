## Release of Mercury


**3** 

- **(1)** The quantity of mercury that the owner or operator of a plant may release into the ambient air from that plant shall not exceed
	- **(a)** 5 grams per day per 1,000 kilograms of rated capacity, where the source of the mercury is the ventilation gases exhausted from cell rooms;
	- **(b)** 0.1 gram per day per 1,000 kilograms of rated capacity, where the source of the mercury is the hydrogen gas stream originating from denuders;
	- **(c)** 0.1 gram per day per 1,000 kilograms of rated capacity, where the source of the mercury is the ventilation gases exhausted from end boxes; and
	- **(d)** 0.1 gram per day per 1,000 kilograms of rated capacity, where the source of the mercury is the gases exhausted from retorts.

- **(2)** No mercury shall be released directly into the ambient air from a tank.

- **(3)** Notwithstanding subsection (1), the total amount of mercury that the owner or operator of a plant may release into the ambient air from the sources specified in subsection (1) shall not exceed 1.68 kilograms per day.

- **(4)** Measurements shall be taken of the amount of mercury released into the ambient air per day from sources specified in subsection (1) by taking the arithmetical average of not less than three measurements conducted for each source in the same day in accordance with the appropriate method, or any other method the results of which can be confirmed by the appropriate method, described in Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Mercury from Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Plants, Department of the Environment Report EPS 1-AP-76-1 dated November 1976, as amended from time to time.

- **(5)** Each measurement of mercury released shall be conducted under normal operating conditions and the minimum continuous sampling duration shall be
	- **(a)** two hours in respect of cell rooms; and
	- **(b)** one hour in respect of all other sources specified in subsection (1).
> SOR/93-231, s. 2; SOR/94-364, s. 2.





## Information and Samples


**4** The Minister may request the owner or operator of a plant to submit to the Minister information and samples respecting the operation of the plant or the malfunction or breakdown of its air pollution control equipment or process equipment.
> SOR/93-231, s. 2(E).





## Release Measurement Report


**5** 

- **(1)** Where, pursuant to section 4, the Minister requests information respecting the operation of a plant, the owner or operator of the plant shall submit to the Minister the information required by the Release Measurement Report set out in Schedule I.

- **(2)** The report referred to in subsection (1) shall be in respect of measurements conducted in accordance with subsections 3(4) and (5) for the appropriate sources at the plant under normal operating conditions during the sixty days preceding the date on which the report is required to be submitted to the Minister pursuant to subsection (3).

- **(3)** The report referred to in subsection (1) shall be submitted to the Minister at regular intervals of not more than three months commencing three months after the request is made by the Minister.

- **(4)** The measurements referred to in subsection (2) shall, at least once per year, be conducted in the presence of an enforcement officer.
> SOR/94-364, s. 2; SOR/2000-102, s. 1.





## Malfunction or Breakdown Report


**6** Where, pursuant to section 4, the Minister requests information respecting a malfunction or breakdown in the air pollution control equipment or the process equipment, the owner or operator of the plant shall, commencing two months after the request is made by the Minister, submit to the Minister, for any month in which a malfunction or breakdown occurs, the information required by the Malfunction or Breakdown Report set out in Schedule II.




## Air Pollution Control Equipment Report


**7** Where, pursuant to section 4, the Minister requests information respecting air pollution control equipment at a plant, the owner or operator of the plant shall submit to the Minister, for each source referred to in subsection 3(1), a duly completed Air Pollution Control Equipment Report as set out in Schedule III within two months after the request is made by the Minister, and at such times thereafter as any change occurs in respect of the air pollution control equipment.
> SOR/93-231, s. 2(E).





## Signing of Reports


**8** Any report submitted under section 5, 6 or 7 by a corporation shall be signed by an officer authorized by the corporation to sign the report on its behalf.

## Submission of Samples and Related Information


**9** 

- **(1)** Where, pursuant to section 4, the Minister requests samples of gas streams released into the ambient air from a plant and such related information as will enable the Minister to cause an analysis to be made of the amount of mercury contained in those gas streams, the owner or operator of the plant shall obtain the samples at regular three month intervals, in accordance with the appropriate method described in Standard Reference Methods for Source Testing: Measurement of Emissions of Mercury from Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Plants, Department of Fisheries and the Environment Report EPS-1-AP-76-1 dated November 1976, as amended from time to time, and shall forthwith submit the samples and related information to the Minister.

- **(2)** For the purposes of subsection (1), at the request of the Minister, the samples shall be taken in the presence of an enforcement officer.
