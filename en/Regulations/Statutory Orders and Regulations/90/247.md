- [CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md)

Date registered: 26 April 1990

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 48(1) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup><a href='#footnote1star_e'>[*]</a></sup>, the Minister of the Environment published in the Canada GazettePart I on July 15, 1989 a copy of the annexed Regulations respecting concentrations of lead and phosphorus in gasoline, substantially in the form annexed hereto;

<a name='footnote1star_e'><sup>*</sup></a>: R.S., c. 16 (4th Supp.)<br />

And Whereas, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, the concentrations of lead and phosphorus in gasoline prescribed in the annexed Regulations, if exceeded, would, on the combustion of the gasoline in ordinary circumstances, result in a significant contribution to air pollution;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, pursuant to section 47 and subsection 87(1) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup>[*]</sup>, is pleased hereby to revoke the Lead-Free Gasoline Regulations, C.R.C., c. 408 and the Leaded Gasoline Regulations, C.R.C., c. 409 and to make the annexed Regulations respecting concentrations of lead and phosphorus in gasoline, in substitution therefor.
