	- **(e)** the concentration of asbestos fibres contained in gases released into the ambient air shall be the arithmetic average of the three measurements conducted in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d).

- **(5)** Where Method S.2 described in the Report referred to in subsection (2) is used,
	- **(a)** one release measurement shall be made;
	- **(b)** the asbestos fibres on each filter shall be counted by two qualified persons, one counting the odd numbered sectors and the other counting the even numbered sectors; and
	- **(c)** the release measurement shall be determined by taking the arithmetic average of the two sets of fibre counts conducted in accordance with paragraph (b).

- **(6)** Where Method S.3 described in the Report referred to in subsection (3) is used,
	- **(a)** three release measurements shall be made;
	- **(b)** each release measurement shall be made during a period of continuous active drilling;
	- **(c)** the asbestos fibres on each filter shall be counted by two qualified persons, one counting the odd numbered sectors and the other counting the even numbered sectors;
