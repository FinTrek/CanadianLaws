## Labelling



**Presentation and information**

**4** A tent must have a label that is permanently affixed to it at a prominent location and that displays in a legible manner
- **(a)** the following statement in upper case letters not less than 3 mm in height:WARNING: KEEP ALL FLAME AND HEAT SOURCES AWAY FROM THIS TENT FABRIC / *MISE EN GARDE : TENIR LE TISSU DE CETTE TENTE LOIN DE TOUTE FLAMME ET DE TOUTE SOURCE DE CHALEUR*;


- **(b)** the following statement:This tent is made of flame-resistant fabric. *It is not fireproof*. The fabric will burn if left in continuous contact with a flame source. / *Cette tente est fabriquée d’un tissu résistant au feu, *mais qui n’est pas ininflammable*. Ce tissu brûlera s’il est laissé en contact continu avec une source d’inflammation.*; and


- **(c)** the precautions set out in Schedule 2, or their equivalent, in English and French.

## Coming into Force



**Registration**

**6** These Regulations come into force on the day on which they are registered.




### **SCHEDULE 1** 
**(Sections 1 to 3)**
## Procedures for Testing Tents

### General Requirements for Testing

**1** A flame test must be performed
- **(a)** under the standard atmospheric conditions specified in section 4.3.1 of CPAI-84, or immediately upon the removal of the specimen from such conditions; and
- **(b)** when the specimen is in moisture equilibrium, within the meaning of section 4.3.2 of CPAI-84.



### Test of Flooring Material

**2** The following method is to be used to determine the damage displayed by specimens of a sample unit of flooring material:
- **(a)** from the flooring material, cut 12 specimens that meet the requirements set out in section 5.1 of CPAI-84;
- **(b)** divide the specimens into three sample units, ensuring that, if the flooring material is woven, none of the specimens within a sample unit contains the same warp yarns, weft yarns or filaments as any other specimen in that sample unit;
- **(c)** prepare one sample unit in accordance with the leaching procedure set out in sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 of CPAI-84;
- **(d)** prepare another sample unit in accordance with the accelerated weathering procedure set out in section 4.2.2 of CPAI-84;
- **(e)** test the three sample units in accordance with the flame test method set out in sections 5.2 and 5.4 of CPAI-84; and
- **(f)** record, for each specimen, the shortest distance between the damaged area and the edge of the hole in the flattening frame.



### Test of Wall and Top Material

**3** The following method is to be used to determine the after-flame time, the average after-flame time, the damaged length and the average damaged length of specimens of a sample unit of wall and top material:
- **(a)** from the wall and top material, cut 24 specimens that meet the requirements set out in section 6.1 of CPAI-84;
- **(b)** divide the specimens into three sample units, ensuring that, if the wall and top material is woven,
	- **(i)** each sample unit contains four specimens from the warp direction and four specimens from the weft direction, and
	- **(ii)** none of the specimens from the warp direction contains the same warp yarns or filaments as any other specimen from the warp direction and none of the specimens from the weft direction contains the same weft yarns or filaments as any other specimen from the weft direction;
- **(c)** prepare one sample unit in accordance with the leaching procedure set out in sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 of CPAI-84;
- **(d)** prepare another sample unit in accordance with the accelerated weathering procedure set out in section 4.2.2 of CPAI-84;
- **(e)** determine the mass per area of the specimens to the nearest g/m<sup>2</sup>, using one specimen from the sample unit that has not been subjected to the leaching or accelerated weathering procedure;
- **(f)** test the three sample units in accordance with the flame test method set out in sections 6.2 and 6.4 of CPAI-84, by replacing the loads for determining the damaged length that are set out in section 6.4.6.1 of that standard with those that are set out in the table to this section; and
- **(g)** record
	- **(i)** the after-flame time of each specimen,
	- **(ii)** the average after-flame time of the specimens of each sample unit,
	- **(iii)** the damaged length of each specimen,
	- **(iv)** the average damaged length of the specimens of each sample unit, and
	- **(v)** the presence of any portions that break, or any residues that drip, from a specimen and that continue to flame after reaching the floor of the test cabinet.
