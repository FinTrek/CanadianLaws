**Migratable limits for lead and cadmium — drinking vessel**

**3** Any drinking vessel with a distinctive exterior decorative pattern within 20 mm of the rim, when tested in accordance with the method set out in section 2 of the schedule, must not release lead in excess of 4 mg/L or cadmium in excess of 0.4 mg/L.




## Identification and Warning



**Exception**

**4** A product that is not intended to be used for food may release lead or cadmium in excess of the migratable limits set out in the table to section 2 if
- **(a)** it is identified by a design feature, such as a hole or mounting hook, that renders the product unsuitable for the storing, preparing or serving of food; or
- **(b)** it displays, in English and French and in capital letters of not less than 3 mm in height, a permanent warning consisting of one of the following texts or a similar text, as may be appropriate:DANGER!

### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 3)**
## Test Methods
**1** The following method, which is based on the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 6486-1:1999, entitled Ceramic ware, glass-ceramic ware and glass dinnerware in contact with food — Release of lead and cadmium — Part 1: Test Method, second edition, December 15, 1999, is to be used to determine whether a product releases lead or cadmium:
- **(a)** handwash the product using a non-acidic detergent solution, rinse with distilled water and air dry;
- **(b)** fill the product to within 5 mm of the level of overflowing with an extraction solution of 4% (volume/volume) of acetic acid in water;
- **(c)** cover the product with an inert opaque cover and allow to stand for 24 hours at 22 ± 2°C;
- **(d)** stir the extraction solution to ensure homogeneity taking care not to abrade the surface of the product;
- **(e)** take an aliquot of the extraction solution and, within eight hours, analyze the solution using an analytical technique that is in accordance with good laboratory practices; and
- **(f)** express the results as the quantity of the lead or cadmium in milligrams per litre of the extraction solution.


**2** The following method, which is based on the American Society for Testing and Materials standard ASTM C927-80 (2004), entitled Standard Test Method for Lead and Cadmium Extracted from the Lip and Rim Area of Glass Tumblers Externally Decorated with Ceramic Glass Enamels, is to be used to determine whether a drinking vessel bearing a distinctive exterior decorative pattern within 20 mm of the rim releases lead or cadmium:
- **(a)** handwash the drinking vessel using a non-acidic detergent solution, rinse with distilled water and air dry;
- **(b)** measure the internal volume of the drinking vessel in millilitres by filling it with distilled water to within 5 mm of the level of overflowing and record the internal volume (V<sub>2</sub>);
- **(c)** discard the water and invert the drinking vessel in an appropriate laboratory glassware container whose diameter is a minimum of 1.25 times and a maximum of 2 times the external diameter of the drinking vessel as measured at the rim;
- **(d)** add to the laboratory glassware container the volume of an extraction solution of 4% (volume/volume) of acetic acid in water that is sufficient to submerge the rim of the drinking vessel in 20 mm of the solution and record the volume of extraction solution used (V<sub>1</sub>);
- **(e)** cover the laboratory glassware container with an inert opaque cover and allow to stand for 24 hours at 22 ± 2°C;
- **(f)** remove the drinking vessel and stir the extraction solution to ensure homogeneity;
- **(g)** take an aliquot of the extraction solution and, within eight hours, analyze the solution using an analytical technique that is in accordance with good laboratory practices; and
- **(h)** express the results as the quantity of the lead or cadmium in milligrams per litre of the extraction solution relative to the internal volume of the drinking vessel as follows:
```
(C × V<sub>1</sub>) / V<sub>2</sub>
```
where
- **C** is the concentration of lead or cadmium in milligrams per litre in the extraction solution used,
- **V** <sub>1</sub>is the volume in millilitres of the extraction solution used, and
- **V** <sub>2</sub>is the internal volume in millilitres of the drinking vessel.
