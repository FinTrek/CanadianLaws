## Interpretation



**Definitions**

***insulation standard*** means the Underwriters Laboratories of Canada standard CAN/ULC-S703, entitled Standard for Cellulose Fibre Insulation for Buildings, as amended from time to time. (*norme sur l’isolant*)




## Specifications



**Minimum critical radiant flux**

**2** 

- **(1)** When cellulose fibre insulation is tested in accordance with section 6.3.9 of the insulation standard, all three test specimens must have a critical radiant flux greater than or equal to 0.12 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.

**Additional specimens**

- **(2)** Despite subsection (1), if only one of the three test specimens has a critical radiant flux less than 0.12 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, three more specimens must be tested, all of which must have a critical radiant flux greater than or equal to 0.12 W/cm<sup>2</sup>.




**Combustion and loss of mass**

**3** Cellulose fibre insulation must not exhibit any flaming combustion or any loss of mass greater than 15% when tested in accordance with sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.12 of the insulation standard.




**Separation of non-cellulosic components**

**4** Cellulose fibre insulation must not exhibit any separation of non-cellulosic components greater than 1.5% by mass when tested in accordance with section 6.3.11 of the insulation standard.




**Corrosiveness — metal**

**5** A test specimen that is made of aluminum, copper or steel must not exhibit any perforation when cellulose fibre insulation is tested in accordance with section 6.3.2 of the insulation standard.




## Information



**Required information**

**6** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), cellulose fibre insulation that is sold to a consumer must have the following information marked on its container legibly and in a prominent location:

		- **(i)** the manufacturer, if the insulation is manufactured in Canada, or
		- **(ii)** the importer, if the insulation is imported; and
	- **(b)** the day, month and year of its manufacture.

**Exception — no container**

- **(2)** If the cellulose fibre insulation has no container, the information must be marked on the packaging or, if there is no packaging, on the bill of sale or other document given to the consumer at the time of sale.
