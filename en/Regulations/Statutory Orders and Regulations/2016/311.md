	- **(b)** in the case of a large air conditioner with a cooling capacity of 70 kW or more, it is manufactured on or after January 1, 2010.




**Energy efficiency standards — cooled by air**

**118** 

- **(1)** The energy efficiency standards set out in column 3 of Table 1 to this section apply to large air conditioners that are cooled by air and described in column 1 and that are manufactured during the period set out in column 4.

## Explanation for Elements on Household Appliance Energy Efficiency Label / *Explication du contenu de l’étiquette indiquant l’efficacité énergétique des appareils domestiques*
> Image: The graphic depicts the form for the bilingual EnerGuide label for a household appliance and provides instructions for the information that must be on the label. Except for the EnerGuide logo, which has white text on a black background, all text on the label is black on a white background. The label displays the following information about the appliance: its annual energy consumption, its type and size category and its model number. The label also displays a horizontal scale that shows the annual energy consumption of the product, expressed in kilowatts, relative to similar models in the same size and type category. From top to bottom, the elements of the label and their associated instructions are the following: The Canada word-mark is at the top of the graphic. The EnerGuide logo is prominently displayed underneath the Canada word-mark. Below, under the heading “Energy consumption”, the value “AAA kWh per year” is prominently displayed. The instruction for this value states “Replace “AAA” with annual energy consumption of model in kilowatt hours”. Next, the label depicts a gradient scale that gradually changes from white on the left to black on the right. The value “BBB kWh” is displayed at the left endpoint of the scale, immediately above a bolded heading that states “Uses least energy”. The instruction for this value states “Replace “BBB” with value of most energy-efficient model within same type and size category.” The value “CCC kWh” is displayed at the right endpoint of the scale, immediately above a bolded heading that states “Uses most energy”. The instruction for this value states “Replace “CCC” with value of least energy-efficient model within same type and size category.” Immediately above the scale and depicted as an inverted black triangle is the energy consumption indicator which is used to mark the relative energy performance of the product at issue. The instruction for this indicator states “Position model on annual energy consumption scale relative to others within same type and size category.” Next below, at the left margin, is the heading “Similar models compared”. The values “DDD” and “EEE”, which are related to this heading, are centered on the graphic. The instruction for those values states “Replace “DDD” with applicable type, if any, and replace “EEE” with applicable size category, if any.” Next below, at the left margin, is the heading “Model number”. The value “FFF”, which is related to this heading, is centered on the graphic. The instruction for this value states “Replace “FFF” with model number.” Lastly, the graphic provides a reminder that “Removal of this label before first retail purchase is an offence (S.C. 1992, c. 36)”.

## Explanation for Elements on Room Air Conditioner Energy Efficiency Label / *Explication du contenu de l’étiquette indiquant l’efficacité énergétique des climatiseurs individuels*
> Image: The graphic depicts the form of the bilingual EnerGuide label for a room air conditioner manufactured before June 2014 and provides instructions for the information that must be on the label. Except for the EnerGuide logo, which has white text on a black background, all text on the label is black on a white background. The label displays the following information about the room air conditioner: its energy efficiency ratio, its type and cooling capacity category and its model number. The label also displays a horizontal scale that shows the energy efficiency of the product relative to similar models in the same size and cooling capacity category. From top to bottom, the elements of the label and their associated instructions are the following: The Canada word-mark is at the top of the graphic. The EnerGuide logo is prominently displayed underneath the Canada word-mark. Below, under the heading “Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER)”, the value “A.A” is prominently displayed. The instruction for this value states “Replace “A.A” with energy efficiency ratio of room air conditioner.” Next, the label depicts a gradient scale that gradually changes from black on the left to white on the right. The value “B.B” is displayed at the left endpoint of the scale, immediately above a bolded heading that states “Least energy-efficient”. The instruction for this value states “Replace “B.B” with value of least energy-efficient model within same type and cooling capacity category.” The value “C.C” is displayed at the right endpoint of the scale, immediately above a bolded heading that states, “Most energy-efficient”. The instruction for this value states “Replace “C.C” with value of most energy-efficient model within same type and cooling capacity category.” Immediately above the scale and depicted as an inverted black triangle is the energy efficiency ratio indicator, which is used to mark the relative energy efficiency of the product at issue. The instruction for this indicator states “Position model on energy efficiency ratio scale relative to others within same type and cooling capacity category.” Next below, at the left margin, is the heading “Similar models compared”. The values “DDD” and “EEE”, which are related to this heading, are centered on the graphic. The instruction for those values states “Replace “DDD” with applicable type and replace “EEE” with applicable cooling capacity category, if any.” Next below, at the left margin, is the heading “Model number”. The value “FFF”, which is related to this heading, is centered on the graphic. The instruction for this value states “Replace “FFF” with model number.” Lastly, the graphic provides a reminder that “Removal of this label before first retail purchase is an offence (S.C. 1992, c. 36)”.
