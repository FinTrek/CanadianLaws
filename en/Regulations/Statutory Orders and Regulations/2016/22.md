**PART 1** 
## Regulatory Activity Plan Charges



### Estimated Annual Charge



**Regulatory activity plan**

**2** For each new project relating to development, production, abandonment, exploratory drilling or multi-year or complex seismic programs in respect of petroleum operations, on receipt of a project description or letter of intent, the Board must
- **(a)** prepare a regulatory activity plan;
- **(b)** calculate the estimated annual charge payable by the applicant or the operator for the project by determining the estimated full cost, including indirect regulatory costs, associated with the implementation of the regulatory activity plan based on
	- **(i)** the cost of the estimated total number of units of time necessary to be spent in that fiscal year on direct regulatory activities for the project, and
	- **(ii)** any other costs, excluding costs calculated under other cost recovery methods; and
- **(c)** notify the applicant or the operator, in writing, of the regulatory activity plan and the estimated annual charge payable.




**Existing project**

**3** For each existing project that was previously under a regulatory activity plan, after approval of the Board’s budget in any given fiscal year following its submission in accordance with subsection 28(2) of the Act, the Board must
- **(a)** prepare a new regulatory activity plan;
- **(b)** calculate the estimated annual charge payable by the applicant or the operator for the project by determining the estimated full cost, including indirect regulatory costs, associated with the implementation of the new regulatory activity plan based on
	- **(i)** the cost of the estimated total number of units of time necessary to be spent in that fiscal year on direct regulatory activities for the project, and
	- **(ii)** any other costs, excluding costs calculated under other cost recovery methods; and
- **(c)** notify the applicant or the operator, in writing, of the new regulatory activity plan and the estimated annual charge payable.




**Recalculation**

**4** If an applicant or operator proposes changes to its project that are not reflected in the regulatory activity plan, the Board may recalculate the estimated annual charge for that project and adjust the payable amount accordingly.




### Quarterly Invoicing



**Invoice**

**5** 

- **(1)** The Board must, on a quarterly basis, prepare and send an invoice for an amount equal to 25% of the estimated annual charge payable to each applicant or operator who has been notified under paragraph 2(c) or 3(c).

**Payment within 30 days**

- **(2)** Within 30 days after the date of the invoice, the applicant or the operator must pay the amount invoiced.




### Annual Charge Adjustment



**Annual adjustment**

**6** 

- **(1)** Each year, following the end of the fiscal year, the Board must, for each project under a regulatory activity plan,
	- **(a)** calculate the actual full cost associated with the implementation of the regulatory activity plan;
	- **(b)** calculate the charge adjustment, if any, by subtracting the estimated annual charge, calculated in accordance with paragraph 2(b) or 3(b), from the actual full cost; and
	- **(c)** notify the applicant or the operator in writing of the amount of the actual full cost and the amount of the charge adjustment.

**Effect of adjustment**

- **(2)** If the actual full cost calculated under paragraph (1)(a) is
	- **(a)** less than the estimated annual charge, the difference is credited to the applicant’s or operator’s account and must be refunded as a credit on the next invoice; or
	- **(b)** greater than the estimated annual charge, the Board must invoice the applicant or the operator for an amount equal to the difference and the applicant or the operator must pay that amount to the Board within 30 days after the date of the invoice.




**PART 2** 
## Formula Fees



### Interpretation



**Interpretation**

**7** In this Part,
- **(a)** base units of time are the number of units of time published by the Board in accordance with section 8 based on the Board’s estimate of the time required for it to undertake direct regulatory activities in relation to each activity set out in the tables to section 9;
- **(b)** variable units of time are the number of units of time published by the Board in accordance with section 8 based on the Board’s estimate of the time required for it to undertake direct regulatory activities in relation to the variables set out in column 3 of the table to subsection 9(3);
- **(c)** the effective rate is the rate published by the Board in accordance with section 8 based on the estimated sum of the costs incurred by the Board’s undertaking of all direct regulatory activities and of the Board’s indirect regulatory costs minus the sum of the costs incurred by the Board’s undertaking of regulatory activities that are not recovered by the Board at the request of the Federal Minister and the Provincial Minister and divided by the total number of units of time spent by the Board for those direct regulatory activities; and
- **(d)** the heavy burden coefficient is a multiplier that the Board may apply to a fee for an activity if the Board is of the opinion that the fee must be increased to reflect the additional number of units of time spent by the Board to undertake direct regulatory activities as a result of non-compliance with the Act, negligence or lack of effort by an applicant or operator in responding to any of the Board’s questions during an application process or activity.




### Publication



**Publication by Board**

**8** Each year the Board must publish, by electronic or other means that is likely to reach applicants and operators,
- **(a)** the base units of time for each activity set out in the tables to section 9;
- **(b)** the variable units of time for each activity set out in the table to subsection 9(3); and
- **(c)** the effective rate.




### Formulas



**Basic formula**

**9** 

- **(1)** The fee for each activity set out in the table to this subsection is determined by the formula
```
A × C
```
where
- **A** is the base units of time related to each activity; and
- **C** is the effective rate.

**Formula without variable units of time**

- **(2)** The fee for each activity set out in column 2 of the table to this subsection is determined by the formula
```
A × C × D
```
where
- **A** is the base units of time related to each activity;
- **C** is the effective rate; and
- **D** if applicable, is the heavy burden coefficient.

**Formula with variable units of time**

- **(3)** The fee for each activity set out in column 2 of the table to this subsection is determined by the formula
```
(A + B) × (C × D)
```
where
- **A** is the base units of time related to each activity;
- **B** is the variable units of time multiplied by the number of primary vessels or aircraft to be used in each activity;
- **C** is the effective rate; and
- **D** if applicable, is the heavy burden coefficient.
