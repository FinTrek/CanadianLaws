**Determination of NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity**

**29** Based on the concentrations of NO<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> as measured in accordance with section 28, the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity, expressed in g/GJ, of the boiler or heater must be determined for each test run
- **(a)** by means of the appropriate calculation of emissions by F-factors set out in Appendix A to the EC CEMS Code; or
- **(b)** by the formula
```
(NO<sub>x</sub> × 1.88 × 10<sup>-3</sup> × F<sub>g</sub>)/Σ<sub>i</sub>(F<sub>i</sub> × HHV<sub>i</sub>)
```
where
- **NO** <sub>x</sub>is the concentration of NO<sub>x</sub> ,
- **F** <sub>g</sub>is the flow rate of the flue gas, expressed in m<sup>3</sup>/h at 25°C and 101.325 kPa, as measured in the test run and determined in accordance with EPA Method 4 or EC Method D and converted to its flow rate on a dry basis in accordance with EPA Method 2 or EC Method B,
- **F** <sub>i</sub>is the flow rate of the ith fuel combusted, expressed for a solid or liquid fuel in a given unit/h and for a gaseous fuel in m<sup>3</sup>/h at 25°C and 101.325 kPa ,

- **i** is the ith fuel combusted, where i goes from 1 to n and n is the number of fuels combusted.




**NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity — average**

**30** The NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of the boiler or heater determined by means of a stack test is the average of the three determinations — one for each test run — of its NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity.




**NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity — deemed hours**

**31** The average referred to in section 30 is deemed to be the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of the boiler or heater
- **(a)** for every hour of the day on which the third test run is conducted; and
- **(b)** for every subsequent hour until its NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity is determined based on another stack test or a CEMS test, if, for each of those subsequent hours,
	- **(i)** the same type of gaseous fossil fuel — natural gas or alternative gas — is introduced into its combustion chamber,
	- **(ii)** for a modern boiler, the thermal efficiency of the boiler is in the same range, namely,

			- **(I)** for a heater that combusts natural gas,
				- **1** > 0 and ≤ 150, or
				- **2** > 150, and
			- **(II)** for a heater that combusts alternative gas,

### Determination of NO<sub>x</sub> Emission Intensity



#### Performance Tests



**NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity limits**

**69** For the purpose of sections 54, 55, 57 and 58, paragraph 59(1)(b) and section 68, the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of an engine must be determined by means of a performance test.




**Three test runs**

**70** 

- **(1)** A performance test consists of three consecutive test runs conducted within the same day, each of which lasts at least 20 minutes and results in a determination of the engine’s NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity.

**Operating conditions for test-runs**

- **(2)** Each test run must be conducted while the engine is
	- **(a)** operating at the lower of
		- **(i)** 90% or more of its rated brake power, and
		- **(ii)** its highest achievable brake power for the operating conditions during the test run; and

	- **(b)** have the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of the engine expressed in ppmvd<sub>15%</sub>.

**After-treatment control devices**

- **(3)** If an after-treatment control device is used, either
	- **(a)** the location of the sampling port described by subsection (1) must also be downstream of the device; or
	- **(b)** for the purpose of paragraph (2)(a), the location of the single traverse point must be downstream of the device — rather than the engine — at a distance from the device of at least twice the diameter of the exhaust pipe.




**Concentration of NO<sub>x</sub>**

**72** 

- **(1)** The concentration of NO<sub>x</sub> in the engine’s exhaust gas for each test run must be determined in accordance with

**Moisture content**

- **(3)** For each test run, if the concentration of NO<sub>x</sub> in the engine’s exhaust gas is measured on a wet basis or if the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of the engine is to be expressed in g/kWh, the moisture content in that gas must be determined in accordance with
	- **(a)** EPA Method 4;

```
where
- **C** <sub>d</sub>is the concentration of NO<sub>x</sub> in the engine’s exhaust gas, expressed in ppmvd, determined at a given percentage of oxygen (%O<sub>2</sub>) in accordance with subsection 72(1); and
- **%O** <sub>2</sub>is the number that represents the percentage of oxygen in the engine’s exhaust gas as determined by volume on a dry basis, based on the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> determined in accordance with subsection 72(2).

**NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity — average**

**75** The NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of the engine determined by means of a performance test is the average of the three determinations — one for each test run — of its NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity.




**NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity — deemed days**

**76** The average described in section 75 is deemed to be the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity of the engine
- **(a)** for the day on which the performance test is conducted; and
- **(b)** for every subsequent day until its NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity is determined based on another performance test.




**Performance tests**

**77** In addition to a performance test referred to in section 69, a performance test to determine the NO<sub>x</sub> emission intensity, expressed in ppmvd<sub>15%</sub> or g/kWh, of a regular-use engine must be conducted

	- **(c)** applying a feedstock-to-clinker conversion factor, specific to the kiln, to a direct measurement of the quantity of feedstock introduced into the kiln during that year, which accurately determines the quantity of clinker that is produced from a given quantity of feedstock introduced.

**Accuracy of feedstock-to-clinker conversion factor**

- **(2)** The accuracy of the feedstock-to-clinker conversion factor must be verified
	- **(a)** at least once per year, but at least four months after a previous verification; and
	- **(b)** as soon as feasible after a major change in the clinker production processes that could affect the accuracy of the factor.

**Record-making**
