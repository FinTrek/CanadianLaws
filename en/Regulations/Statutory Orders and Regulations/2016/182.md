***lot*** means a stock, batch, shipment or delivery lot of matches. (*lot*)

***striking surface*** means that part of a book, box or other container of matches that is for the purpose of igniting matches. (*frottoir*)

## Specifications



**Matches**

**2** 

- **(1)** Matches must meet the following requirements:
	- **(a)** the match must not contain any white phosphorus;
	- **(b)** the ignition compound must be uniformly applied; and
	- **(c)** the match head must not be chipped, cracked or crumbling and must not adhere to the head of another match.

**Additional requirement — wood matches**

- **(2)** The splint of a wood match must be made of good grade and long-fibre wood and must not be broken, split or crushed.




**Matchbooks**

**3** A matchbook must meet the following requirements:
- **(a)** its cover must, when closed, cover all the match heads;
- **(b)** any fastening wire used to secure its cover to the common base of the matches must not pierce or loosen the striking surface;
- **(c)** any friction paint on the inside of the cover must not be present within 2.54 cm of the match heads; and
- **(d)** its striking surface must be on the side that is opposite to the side that opens.




**Spontaneous ignition**

**4** Matches must not ignite spontaneously when tested in accordance with Schedule 1.




**Non-disintegration of ignition compound**

**5** The ignition compound must not, when ignited, crack, explode or drop as glowing particles from the match.




**Afterglow**

**6** The splint of a match must not glow for more than three seconds after the flame has been extinguished.




**Breaking resistance of splints**

**7** When tested in accordance with Schedule 2, the splint of a match must withstand the following moments without breaking:
- **(a)** in the case of a wood match, 700 gf∙cm;
- **(b)** in the case of a round match other than a wood match, 100 gf∙cm; and
- **(c)** in any other case,
	- **(i)** 300 gf∙cm, when the match is placed on its edge, and
	- **(ii)** 100 gf∙cm, when the match is placed flat.




## Information



**Name and mailing address**

**8** Every matchbook, box or other container that immediately covers or encloses the matches must carry on it the name and mailing address of the following, in a clear and legible manner:
- **(a)** the manufacturer, if the matches are manufactured in Canada; or
- **(b)** the importer or distributor, if the matches are imported.




## Compliance



**Matches**

**9** In order to determine whether a lot of matches complies with the requirements of paragraphs 2(1)(b) and (c), subsection 2(2) and sections 5 to 7, the following procedures are to be used:
- **(a)** select at random, based on the number of matches in a lot set out in Column 1 of Table 1 of Schedule 3, a sample that consists of the number of matches set out in Column 2;
- **(b)** if a match fails to meet any requirement set out in sections 5 to 7, determine that the match has a major defect;
- **(c)** if a match fails to meet a requirement set out in paragraphs 2(1)(b) or (c) or subsection 2(2), determine that the match has a minor defect; and
- **(d)** if the number of matches having a major defect is equal to or greater than the number of matches set out in Column 3 of the same table, or if the number of matches having a minor defect is equal to or greater than the number of matches set out in Column 4 of that table, determine that the lot does not comply with the requirements set out in paragraph 2(1)(b) or (c), subsection 2(2) or any of sections 5 to 7, as the case may be.




**Matchbooks**

**10** In order to determine whether a lot of matchbooks complies with the requirements of paragraphs 3(a) to (c), the following procedures are to be used:
- **(a)** select at random, based on the number of matchbooks in a lot set out in Column 1 of Table 2 of Schedule 3, a sample that consists of the number of matchbooks set out in Column 2;
- **(b)** if a matchbook fails to meet any requirement in paragraphs 3(a) to (c), determine that the matchbook has a defect; and
- **(c)** if the number of matchbooks having a defect is equal to or greater than the number of matchbooks set out in Column 3 of the same table, determine that the lot does not comply with one or more of the requirements set out in paragraphs 3(a) to (c).

**Registration**

**12** These Regulations come into force on the day on which they are registered.




### **SCHEDULE 1** 
**(Section 4)**
## Spontaneous Ignition Test
**1** The following method is to be used for testing the spontaneous ignition of matches:
- **(a)** place, on a flat surface, a wooden block that is 22 mm thick and 50 mm<sup>2</sup> that has a hole that is 25 mm in diameter;
- **(b)** fill the hole in the block with the matches to be tested, so that the base of each match is resting on the flat surface, with the match heads pointing up;
- **(c)** place the block in the centre of a convection oven at a temperature of 90 ± 1°C;
- **(d)** place a temperature sensing device having a range of  65 to 120°C at a minimum distance of 6.5 mm and a maximum distance of 12 mm from, and at the same level as, the match heads; and
- **(e)** leave the matches in the oven for a minimum period of two hours.





### **SCHEDULE 2** 
**(Section 7)**
## Test for Breaking Resistance of Splints
**1** The following method is to be used for testing the breaking resistance of splints:
- **(a)** insert the match in the holding clamp of the apparatus as illustrated in the figure, while ensuring that the moment arm is
	- **(i)** 2 cm in length, in the case of wood matches; or
	- **(ii)** 1.5 cm in length, in the case of matches other than wood matches;
- **(b)** gradually lower the holding clamp until the match breaks; and
- **(c)** record the maximum force registered on the scale required to break the splint.


> Image: Illustration depicting specifications of the apparatus used to test for the breaking resistance of splints. The screw and pinion arrangement for lowering the holding clamp is shown. The moment arm where the matches are tested is perpendicular to the knife edge.
