**Signal word “DANGER”**

- **(3)** If the warning required by subsection (1) or (2) is displayed in separate English and French display panels, the signal word “**DANGER**” must be displayed in each display panel, but if the warning is displayed in one bilingual display panel, the signal word “**DANGER**” need only be displayed once.
