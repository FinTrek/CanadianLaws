- **(a)** assemble the product according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** set up a horizontal test surface with an aluminum angle stop that is, subject to paragraph (c), 25 mm high and 25 mm wide and that is at least 150 mm longer than the product that is being tested;
- **(c)** if the cradle or bassinet has a rocking base, the angle stop must be of a height that, when the product is tilted, no part of its rounded base moves on top of the angle stop;
- **(d)** position the product in one of the manufacturer’s recommended use positions and place it against the angle stop;
- **(e)** place a CAMI Newborn Dummy with its arms and legs straightened and face up on the geometric centre of the appropriate mattress or, in the case of a product that is designed to be used without a mattress, on the geometric centre of the surface that supports the weight of the child;
- **(f)** gradually apply a 10-kg static vertical load over a period of five seconds to the location along the upper horizontal rail on the side that is closest to the angle stop and that is most likely to tip the product over;
- **(g)** while maintaining the vertical load, gradually apply a horizontal force of 22 N in the direction of the angle stop, over a period of five seconds, to the same location where the vertical load is applied;
- **(h)** maintain both the vertical load and the horizontal force for a further 10 seconds;
- **(i)** rotate the product 90° and repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (d) to (h);
- **(j)** repeat the step set out in paragraph (i) twice more;
- **(k)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (d) to (j) for all the other manufacturer’s recommended use positions; and
- **(l)** if the cradle or bassinet is designed or advertised to be used with a stand, put the product on the stand according to the stand manufacturer’s instructions and repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (k).





### **SCHEDULE 12** 
**(Section 42)**
## Entrapment in Accessories Test Method
**1** The following method is to be used for testing openings that are created when an accessory is placed on or fixed to a crib:
- **(a)** assemble the crib and the accessory or accessories, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** fix the accessory or combination of accessories to the crib — or place it or them on the crib — in one of the manufacturer’s recommended use positions and identify any openings that are created and that are likely to permit the passage of the small head probe illustrated in the figure to Schedule 7 but not the large head probe illustrated in the figure to this section;
- **(c)** rotate the small head probe to the orientation that is most likely to permit its passage through one of the identified openings and, from inside the occupant retention area of the crib, gradually apply an upward or outward force of 111 N to the probe over a period of five seconds, then maintain the force for 10 seconds;
- **(d)** if the small head probe can pass entirely through the opening, repeat the steps set out in paragraph (c) using the large head probe and attempt to pass it, without forcing it, through the opening in any orientation;
- **(e)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) for all the other identified openings; and
- **(f)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (e) for all the other manufacturer’s recommended use positions.
> Image: The large head probe is meant to simulate the head of a 97th percentile three-year-old child. The large head probe is shaped like a cylinder that narrows slightly and that has a flattened end that is opposite from the bottom of the probe. The height of the probe is 101.6 mm. The diameter of the probe is constant at 228.6 mm for the first 25.4 mm of height, measured from the bottom of the probe, and is then reduced to 203.2 mm over the next 76.2 mm of height. A handle protrudes from the centre of the probe.



**2** The following method is to be used for testing openings that are created by the detachment or displacement of an accessory from a crib:
- **(a)** assemble the crib and the accessory or accessories, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, omitting any attachments that could interfere with the conduct of the test;
- **(b)** fix the accessory or combination of accessories to the crib — or place it or them on the crib — in one of the manufacturer’s recommended use positions, and identify the parts of the accessory that are most likely to detach or become displaced and so create an opening;
- **(c)** using a pad that has a tip with a diameter of 50 mm gradually apply, from within the occupant retention area of the crib, an upward or outward force of 111 N over a period of five seconds to one of the identified locations;
- **(d)** if an opening is created, attempt to pass the small head probe illustrated in the figure to Schedule 7, without forcing it, through the opening in any orientation;
- **(e)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (c) and (d) by applying the force to all the other identified parts of the accessory; and
- **(f)** repeat the steps set out in paragraphs (b) to (e) for all the other manufacturer’s recommended use positions.

## Standard Sans-serif Type
> Image: The height of the lower case letter “x” is the “x-height”. The part of the lower case letter “b” that is above the x-height is called an “ascender”. The part of the lower case letter “p” that is below the x-height is called a “descender”.
