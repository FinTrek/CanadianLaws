		- **(ii)** the maximum number of hours of exposure per 24-hour period set out in Column II of that item.

- **(3)** Where it is not reasonably practicable for an employer to maintain the exposure of an employee to a level of sound at or below the levels referred to in subsection (1) or (2), the employer shall
	- **(a)** make a report in writing to the Minister setting out the reasons why the exposure cannot be so maintained; and
	- **(b)** provide every employee entering the work place with a hearing protector that
		- **(i)** meets the standards set out in CSA Standard Z94.2-M1984, Hearing Protectors, the English version of which is dated June 1984 and the French version of which is dated February 1985, and
		- **(ii)** reduces the level of sound reaching the employee’s ears to less than 85 dB.
> SOR/94-165, s. 21; SOR/2014-148, s. 24.




**8.3** No employee shall be exposed in sleeping quarters to a level of sound of more than 75 dB.

- **(a)** meets the standards set out in CSA Standard Z94.2-M1984, Hearing Protectors, the English version of which is dated June 1984 and the French version of which is dated February 1985; and
- **(b)** reduces the peak level of impulse sound reaching the employee’s ears to 140 dB or less.




### Sound Level Measurement


**8.5** The levels of sound referred to in sections 8.2 and 8.3 shall be measured by using the slow exponential-time-averaging characteristic and the A-weighting characteristic of a sound level meter.



**8.6** The level of impulse sound referred to in section 8.4 shall be measured by using the impulse exponential-time-averaging characteristic of a sound level meter.




### Warning Signs


**8.7** In a work place where the level of sound is 85 dB or more or where the peak level of impulse sound exceeds 140 dB, the employer shall post signs warning persons entering the work place
- **(a)** that there is a hazardous level of sound or impulse sound in the work place;
- **(b)** if applicable, of the maximum number of hours of exposure determined under subsection 8.2(2); and
- **(c)** if applicable, of the requirement to wear a hearing protector.
