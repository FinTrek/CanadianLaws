***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the assigned elevation of the airport reference point is 545.9 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described as follows:
- **(a)** the lands within the outer limits of lands described in Part VI of the schedule; and
- **(b)** the lands directly under that portion of the approach surfaces that extend beyond the said outer limits.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may direct the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing to remove the growth or the excessive portion thereof.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit that land or any part of it to be used for the disposal of any waste that is edible by or attractive to birds.

## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2 and S-1448-6, dated December 31, 1984, is determined by measuring 975.36 m southeasterly along the centre line and centre line produced of runway 01-19 from the northerly end of the strip and thence measuring southwesterly at right angles 152.40 m from the centre line of the said runway 01-19.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-1, S-1448-2, S-1448-3, S-1448-4, S-1448-5 and S-1448-7, dated December 31, 1984, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 01-19 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 19 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 01 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; the said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; excepting thereout and therefrom all lands lying within the boundaries of the Province of Quebec as shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plan S-1448-3, dated December 31, 1984.

**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 01-19, as shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2, S-1448-5, S-1448-6 and S-1448-7, dated December 31, 1984, is 300 m in width, 150 m on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1948.8 m in length.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2, S-1448-4, S-1448-5, S-1448-6 and S-1448-7, dated December 31, 1984, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Outer Limits of Lands

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Public Works Canada Wabush Airport Zoning Plans S-1448-2, S-1448-4, S-1448-8, S-1448-9 and S-1448-10, dated December 31, 1984, is a circular area beginning at the point where a radius of 4 000 m from the airport reference point intersects the centre line extension of runway 01-19 and thence continues in a clockwise direction along an arc of a curve having a radius of 4 000 m with a centre located at the airport reference point, until it intersects the northerly shoreline of Little Wabush Lake-Harrie Lake; thence following the shoreline of Little Wabush Lake-Harrie Lake in a general westerly direction until it intersects the southerly extension of the centre line of Bartlett Drive; thence northeasterly following the said centre line extension and the centre line of Bartlett Drive until it intersects the centre line of Matthew Avenue; thence northwesterly following the centre line of Matthew Avenue until it intersects the centre line of Hudson Drive; thence northeasterly following the centre line of Hudson Drive until it intersects the centre line of Fermont Highway; thence northerly following the centre line of Fermont Highway until the centre line intersects a radius of 4 000 m from the above-mentioned airport reference point; thence following the said radius in a clockwise direction to the point of beginning.
