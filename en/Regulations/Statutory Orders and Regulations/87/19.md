### **FORM 3.1** 
**(Subsection 18(3.1))**
## Spouse’s or Common-Law Partner’s Consent for the Transfer of a Pension Benefit Credit
I, _________________________, hereby certify that I am the spouse or common-law partner as defined by the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md), of _________________________.


I understand that my spouse or common-law partner has elected to transfer their pension benefit credit and that my written consent is required to enable my spouse or common-law partner to do so.


I understand that

**(a)** transferring the pension benefit credit will allow my spouse or common-law partner to manage their own pension fund and will allow flexibility in determining the amount that will be paid to my spouse or common-law partner in each calendar year;



**(b)** the transferred funds may be used to purchase a life annuity at a later date, but there is no requirement that the funds be used to purchase a life annuity;



**(c)** if the transferred funds are used to purchase a life annuity, the life annuity must be in the joint and survivor form unless I waive my entitlements by signing a separate waiver form within 90 days before the day on which the annuity payments begin.




I further understand that transferring the pension benefit credit to a retirement savings plan of the prescribed kind will allow my spouse or common-law partner to withdraw some of the funds each year, subject to any minimum and maximum withdrawal limits. I understand, however, that the amount of pension income or survivor benefit available to me in later years may be significantly reduced if

**(a)** my spouse or common-law partner elects to withdraw the maximum amount permitted each year; or



**(b)** the investment performance is poor.




Nevertheless, I consent to the transfer of the pension benefit credit to a retirement savings plan of the prescribed kind and certify that

**(a)** I have read this form and understand it;



**(b)** neither my spouse or common-law partner nor anyone else has put any pressure on me to sign this form;



**(c)** I realize that

**(i)** this form only gives a general description of the legal rights I have under the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md) and the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985, and



**(ii)** if I wish to understand exactly what my legal rights are I must read the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md) and the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations,1985 or seek legal advice; and





**(d)** I realize that I am entitled to keep a copy of this consent form.




To consent to the transfer, I sign this consent form at _________________________ on _________________________, 20_________________________.

When payment of an immediate pension benefit is to commence following the phased retirement period, a new election as to the form of that benefit may be made in accordance with subsection 22(5) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md).


### **FORM 5.2** 
**(Section 23.3)**
## Spouse’s or Common-Law Partner’s Consent to the Election To Receive a Variable Benefit from a Defined Contribution Provision
I, _________________________, hereby certify that I am the spouse or the common-law partner, as defined in the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md), of _________________________.


I understand that my spouse or common-law partner has elected to receive a variable benefit directly from the pension plan, and that my written consent is required to enable my spouse or common-law partner to do so.


I understand that

(a) electing to receive a variable benefit directly from the pension plan will allow my spouse or common-law partner to manage his or her own pension fund and will allow some flexibility in determining the amount that will be paid as a variable benefit in each calendar year;



(b) the remaining funds may be used to purchase a life annuity at a later date, but there is no requirement that the remaining funds be used to purchase a life annuity;



(c) if the remaining funds are used to purchase a life annuity, the life annuity must be joint unless I waive my entitlements by signing a separate waiver form within 90 days before the day on which the annuity payments begin; and



(d) a variable benefit paid directly from the pension plan is not paid in the joint and survivor form.




I further understand that before purchasing a life annuity, the pension plan will allow my spouse or common-law partner to withdraw some of the funds each year, subject to minimum and maximum withdrawal limits. I understand, however, that the amount of pension income or survivor benefit available to me in later years may be significantly reduced if

(a) my spouse or common-law partner elects to withdraw the maximum amount permitted each year; or



(b) the investment performance is poor.




Nevertheless, I consent to the receipt of variable benefits directly from the pension plan, and certify that

(a) I have read this form and understand it;



(b) neither my spouse or common-law partner nor anyone else has put any pressure on me to sign this form;



(c) I realize that

(i) this form only gives a general description of the legal rights I have under the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md) and the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985, and



(ii) if I wish to understand exactly what my legal rights are I must read the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md) and the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations,1985 or seek legal advice; and





(d) I realize that I am entitled to a copy of this consent form.




To consent to the transfer, I sign this consent form at _________________________ on _________________________, 20_________________________.

## Consent of Spouse or Common-Law Partner to the Cessation of the Payment of the Joint and Survivor Pension Benefit
I, _________________________, hereby certify that I am (a) the spouse or (b) the common-law partner, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md), of _________________________, a retired former member of the pension plan known as _________________________.


Under the terms of that pension plan

(a) the amount of the joint and survivor pension benefit payable to my spouse or common-law partner as a retired former member is $_________________________ per year; and



(b) the amount of the survivor benefit that would be payable to me on the death of my spouse or common-law partner is $_________________________ per year.




I understand that:

My consent to the cessation of the payment of the joint and survivor pension benefit described in paragraph (a) is required to allow the payment of a phased retirement benefit to my spouse or common-law partner.



By giving my consent, I am no longer entitled to the survivor benefit described in paragraph (b) that currently would be payable to me on the death of my spouse or common-law partner.



If my spouse or common-law partner dies while receiving a phased retirement benefit, the survivor benefit will be payable to the person who is at that time his or her spouse or common-law partner.



A new election as to the form of the immediate pension benefit that will commence after the phased retirement period may be made when that benefit commences, in accordance with subsection 22(5) of the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1985/c.%2032%20(2nd%20Supp.).md).
