## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Stephenville Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means the Stephenville Airport in the electoral district of Port au Port, in the Province of Newfoundland; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the assigned elevation of the airport reference point is deemed to be 15 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described as follows:
- **(a)** the lands within the outer limits of lands described in Part VI of the schedule; and
- **(b)** the lands directly under that portion of the approach surfaces that extend beyond the said outer limits.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the growth or the excessive portion thereof.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit that land or any part of it to be used for the disposal of any waste edible by or attractive to birds.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(ss. 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of the Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point, shown on Public Works Canada Stephenville Airport Zoning Plans S-1670-4 and S-1670-5 dated July 31, 1985, is determined by measuring 1 585 m northeasterly along the projected centre line of runway 10-28 from its intersection with the westerly end of the strip; thence measuring northwesterly at right angles 150 m from the said centre line of runway 10-28 to the northerly edge of the strip; the said point having co-ordinate values of N 5 378 350.07 m and E 301 010.98 m.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Public Works Canada Stephenville Airport Zoning Plans S-1670-0, S-1670-1, S-1670-4, S-1670-5, S-1670-8 and S-1670-9, dated July 31, 1985, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 10-28 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 10 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 28 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m measured vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Public Works Canada Stephenville Airport Zoning Plans S-1670-0, S-1670-1, S-1670-2, S-1670-3, S-1670-4, S-1670-5, S-1670-6, S-1670-7 and S-1670-8, dated July 31, 1985, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the imaginary surface is located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 10-28, as shown on Public Works Canada Stephenville Airport Zoning Plans S-1670-0, S-1670-4 and S-1670-5 dated July 31, 1985, is 300 m in width, 150 m on each side of the centre line of the runway and 3 170 m in length.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Public Works Canada Stephenville Airport Zoning Plans S-1670-0, S-1670-1, S-1670-4, S-1670-5 and S-1670-8 dated July 31, 1985, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and centre line produced of the strip extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to its intersection with the outer surface.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Public Works Canada Stephenville Airport Zoning Plans S-1670-0, S-1670-1, S-1670-2, S-1670-3, S-1670-4, S-1670-5, S-1670-6, S-1670-7 and S-1670-8 dated July 31, 1985, is a circular area having a radius of 4 000 metres from the airport reference point.
