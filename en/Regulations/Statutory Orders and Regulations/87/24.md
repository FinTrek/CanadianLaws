## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to materials referred to in section 5.



**4** 

- **(1)** Where dangerous materials are carried on an unmanned barge under tow, the requirements of these Regulations respecting the Dangerous Materials Shipping Statement and the requirements of the IMO Code respecting portable testing equipment apply to the towing vessel and not to the barge.

- **(2)** Where dangerous materials are carried on barges that are joined together and towed as a single unit, those barges shall, for the purposes of these Regulations, be regarded as a single ship.




## General


**5** The materials in solid form, carried in bulk on board a ship that are listed in Column I of Schedule I are hereby declared to be dangerous goods.



**6** The method of packing and storing dangerous materials, the quantity of such materials that may be carried into a ship and the place or places within a ship in which the dangerous materials may be carried are the method, quantity and place or places set out in the IMO Code.



**7** 

- **(1)** Every person
	- **(a)** engaged in the loading, unloading or stowing of dangerous materials, or
	- **(b)** on or in the vicinity of a ship where dangerous materials are loaded, unloaded or carried
shall take the general precautions applicable to such loading, unloading, stowing or carrying specified in the IMO Code.

- **(2)** Every person on a ship who enters a closed cargo space containing dangerous materials or who enters any closed space adjacent to that cargo space, shall wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, shall be equipped with safety equipment and protective clothing as set out in the IMO Code, and shall be under the supervision of a ship’s officer appointed by the master.

- **(3)** An officer of a ship or, in the case of an unmanned barge, the person in charge of the barge shall be present during the loading or unloading of dangerous materials into or from the ship or barge and while the cargo spaces of the ship or barge are open, in order to supervise any operations under way.

- **(4)** The master of a tug about to take charge of an unmanned barge carrying dangerous materials shall, prior to the commencement of any voyage, ensure that the materials are, as far as possible, properly loaded and in a fit state for carriage and that he has in his possession the necessary shipping documents and cargo information required by these Regulations.

- **(5)** The master or person in charge of a ship carrying dangerous materials shall place warning notices in conspicuous places on board the ship indicating where smoking and the use of naked lights and spark-producing equipment are prohibited.



**8** 

- **(1)** The master of a ship carrying dangerous materials shall ensure that, prior to loading,
	- **(a)** every cargo space is thoroughly cleaned of all loose debris, dunnage and oil residue;
	- **(b)** every cargo space is dry; and
	- **(c)** the bilges in every cargo space are substantially dry and free from extraneous material and are capable of allowing water outside the bilges to drain to the bilge sections while preventing the cargo from entering the bilges.

- **(2)** No person shall load or unload incompatible dangerous materials and other cargo simultaneously.

- **(3)** The person in charge of loading or unloading the materials and cargo referred to in subsection (2) shall, after stowing the materials and cargo in a cargo space, close the hatch cover to the space and clear the deck of all residue prior to stowing any other cargo.

- **(4)** Where dangerous materials that are incompatible according to the IMO Code are to be transported, the person in charge of loading the materials shall ensure that the segregation between them is in accordance with the IMO Code.

- **(5)** Where dangerous materials are to be transported with other dangerous materials in packaged or unitized form, the person in charge of loading the materials shall ensure that the segregation between them is in accordance with the IMO Code.




## Shipping Documents


**9** 

- **(1)** Every shipper of dangerous materials to be carried by ship or barge or any authorized officer of that shipper shall make, sign and date a Dangerous Materials Shipping Statement containing the information specified in Schedule II and ensure that the statement is delivered to the master of the ship or the person in charge of the barge before the materials are loaded into the ship or barge.

- **(2)** The master of every ship carrying dangerous materials shall keep in his possession the Dangerous Materials Shipping Statement made in respect of those dangerous materials at all times while the materials are on the ship.

- **(3)** Where dangerous materials are carried on a barge that is unmanned, unattended and not under tow, the person in charge of the barge shall ensure that the Dangerous Materials Shipping Statement is carried on the barge in a manner that will keep the document clean and dry and that will permit the document to be readily accessible for examination by an inspector.
