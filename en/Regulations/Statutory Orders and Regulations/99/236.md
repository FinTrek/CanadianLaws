# Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations

**SOR/99-236**

Enabling authorities: 
- [CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md)

Date registered: 4 June 1999

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 48(1) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup>, the Minister of the Environment published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on October 31, 1998, a copy of the proposed Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations, substantially in the form set out in the annexed regulations, and persons were given an opportunity to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection;

And whereas, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, the concentration of sulphur in gasoline prescribed in the annexed regulations, if exceeded, would, on the combustion of the gasoline in ordinary circumstances, result in a significant contribution to air pollution;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, pursuant to sections 47<sup><a href='#footnoteb_e'>[b]</a></sup> and 87 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup>[a]</sup>, hereby makes the annexed Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations.

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 16 (4th Supp.)<br />

<a name='footnoteb_e'><sup>b</sup></a>: S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 144 (Sch. VII, item 18)<br />

## Requirements Pertaining to a Pool Average



### Pool Average Election


**9** 

- **(1)** A primary supplier may elect to calculate the concentration of sulphur in gasoline on the basis of a single pool average for
	- **(a)** gasoline produced at a particular refinery or blending facility or imported into a particular province,
	- **(b)** gasoline produced at two or more refineries and blending facilities that are located in the same province, if their combined annual production is not more than 12 000 m<sup>3</sup>,
	- **(c)** gasoline imported into a province and gasoline produced at one or more refineries or blending facilities that are located in that province, if the total amount produced and imported annually is not more than 12 000 m<sup>3</sup>,
by notifying the Minister to that effect at least 60 days before the start of the first year in respect of which the calculation will be made on that basis.

- **(2)** Notice of an election under subsection (1) shall
	- **(a)** specify the refinery, blending facility or province of importation, or the combination of them, to which the election applies; and

### Calculation of Pool Average


**10** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsections (2) to (4) and section 11, a primary supplier shall calculate a pool average for each refinery, blending facility and province of importation, and for each combination thereof, in respect of which it elected under section 9, for all gasoline identified as low-sulphur gasoline under section 5.

- **(2)** In calculating a pool average, a primary supplier shall exclude all batches of low-sulphur gasoline that were exported by the primary supplier or an affiliate of the primary supplier.

- **(3)** Where a primary supplier imports and delivers a batch of low-sulphur gasoline to a refinery or a blending facility, the primary supplier may include that batch in the pool average for the refinery or blending facility if the batch is excluded from the pool average for the province of importation.

- **(4)** Where a primary supplier dispatches from a refinery and delivers, or imports and delivers, gasoline-like blendstock to a blending facility where it is blended to produce a batch of low-sulphur gasoline, the primary supplier may include that batch in the pool average for the refinery or province of importation, as the case may be, if
	- **(a)** the primary supplier owns the gasoline-like blendstock; and
	- **(b)** the gasoline-like blendstock is segregated from all other batches of gasoline stored at the blending facility.

- **(5)** Where a primary supplier dispatches from a refinery or imports a batch of low-sulphur gasoline that is subsequently mixed with a sulphur-limited oxygenate or sulphur-limited butane in a facility, the primary supplier may adjust the recorded concentration of sulphur of the batch to reflect the addition of the sulphur-limited oxygenate or the sulphur-limited butane, and may use the adjusted recorded concentration, instead of the measured concentration for that batch, in calculating the pool average for the refinery or province of importation, as the case may be, if
	- **(a)** the primary supplier owns the batch; and
	- **(b)** where the facility is not a mobile facility, the primary supplier’s refinery or source of importation is the facility’s sole source of gasoline.

- **(1)** A primary supplier who elects to calculate the concentration of sulphur on the basis of a pool average under section 9 may also elect, in the notice required under that section, to use the alternative averaging calculation method described in subsection (2) for the period beginning on July 1, 2002 and ending on December 31, 2004 by
	- **(a)** informing the Minister of the primary supplier’s election to use the alternative averaging calculation method; and
	- **(b)** providing an estimate of the primary supplier’s anticipated volume-weighted average concentration of sulphur in its gasoline as of the end of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.

- **(2)** For the purpose of calculating a pool average, the alternative averaging calculation method is the same as the method described in section 10 but, for the period beginning July 1, 2002 and ending on December 31, 2004, the period over which the pool average is calculated is July 1, 2002 to December 31, 2004, inclusive.

- **(3)** In the reports required under section 4 for the years 2002 and 2003 and where a primary supplier has elected under subsection (1) to use the alternative averaging calculation method and despite subparagraph 4(2)(c)(i), the primary supplier shall report the volume-weighted average concentration of sulphur in its gasoline in the report submitted under subsection 4(1) instead of its pool average for the period
	- **(a)** beginning July 1, 2002 and ending on December 31, 2002, in respect of the report for the year 2002; and
	- **(b)** beginning July 1, 2002 and ending on December 31, 2003 in respect of the report for the year 2003.




### Record of Composition

- **(a)** a unique identification number that links the batch to any sample taken;
- **(b)** the date or dates on which the primary supplier dispatched or imported the batch; and
- **(c)** the concentration of sulphur, the volume and the grade of the batch.
