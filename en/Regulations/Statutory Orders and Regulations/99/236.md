# Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations

**SOR/99-236**

Enabling authorities: 
- [CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999](/en/Acts/Statutes%20of%20Canada/1999/c.%2033.md)

Date registered: 4 June 1999

----------

Whereas, pursuant to subsection 48(1) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup><a href='#footnotea_e'>[a]</a></sup>, the Minister of the Environment published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on October 31, 1998, a copy of the proposed Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations, substantially in the form set out in the annexed regulations, and persons were given an opportunity to file a notice of objection requesting that a board of review be established and stating the reasons for the objection;

And whereas, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, the concentration of sulphur in gasoline prescribed in the annexed regulations, if exceeded, would, on the combustion of the gasoline in ordinary circumstances, result in a significant contribution to air pollution;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, pursuant to sections 47<sup><a href='#footnoteb_e'>[b]</a></sup> and 87 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act<sup>[a]</sup>, hereby makes the annexed Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations.

<a name='footnotea_e'><sup>a</sup></a>: R.S., c. 16 (4th Supp.)<br />
