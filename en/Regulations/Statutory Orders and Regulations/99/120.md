- **(2)** Subject to subsection (3), the Corporation shall assign to each member institution the score set out in column 2 of an item of Schedule 4 that corresponds to the examiner’s rating for the institution set out in column 1 of that item, which rating is the most recent of the following ratings that is available to the Corporation, namely,
	- **(a)** the examiner’s rating as of April 30 of the filing year;
	- **(b)** the most recent examiner’s rating assigned to the institution during the period beginning on May 1 of the year preceding the filing year and ending on April 29 of the filing year; and
	- **(c)** the examiner’s rating used for the evaluation of the member institution for the preceding premium year.

- **(3)** If none of the examiner’s ratings referred to in subsection (2) is available to the Corporation for the member institution, the score to be assigned to the institution for the qualitative factor under this section shall be the result determined in accordance with the formula
```
(A ÷ 65) × 35
```
where
- **A** is the sum of the scores assigned to the member institution under sections 21 to 27 and 30.
