## Names



### Interpretation


**8** The definitions in this section apply in this Part.

***distinctive***, in relation to a trade-name, means a trade-name that distinguishes the business in association with which it is used by its owner from any other business or that is adapted so as to distinguish them from each other. (*distinctif*)

***secondary meaning***, in relation to a trade-name, means a trade-name that has been used in Canada or elsewhere by an applicant or an applicant’s predecessors so as to have become distinctive in Canada as of the date of filing an application for a cooperative name. (*sens dérivé*)

***trade-mark*** means a trade-mark as defined in section 2 of the Trade-marks Act. (*marque de commerce*)

> SOR/2001-513, s. 6.





### Confusion of Names


**9** A cooperative name is confusing with
- **(a)** a trade-mark if the use of both the cooperative name and the trade-mark is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the cooperative name and the business connected with the trade-mark are one business, whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same; or
- **(b)** a trade-name if the use of both names is likely to lead to the inference that the business carried on or intended to be carried on under the cooperative name and the business carried on under the trade-name are one business, whether or not the nature of the business of each is generally the same.




### Consideration of Whole Name


**10** When determining whether a trade-name is distinctive, the name as a whole and not only its separate elements shall be considered.




### Prohibited Names


**11** For the purpose of paragraph 23(a) of the Act, a cooperative name is prohibited in respect of a request to reserve a name, or in respect of an application for revival under section 308 of the Act, if it is the same as, or is confusing with, a cooperative name that has, before the date of the request, been reserved by the Director for another person, unless
- **(a)** written consent has been obtained from the person for whom the name was reserved; or
- **(b)** the 90-day reservation period referred to in section 22 of the Act has expired without the person for whom the name was reserved having renewed the request to reserve the cooperative name.
> SOR/2001-513, s. 7.

- **(b)** is sponsored or controlled by or is affiliated with the Government of Canada, the government of a province, the government of a country other than Canada or a political subdivision or agency of any such government, unless the appropriate government, political subdivision or agency consents in writing to the use of the name;

**15**

	- **(b)** primarily or only the name or surname, used alone, of an individual who is living or has died within 30 years before the date of the request to the Director for that name; or
