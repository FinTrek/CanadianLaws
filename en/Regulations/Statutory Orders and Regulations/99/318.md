	- **(d)** technically and economically feasible measures that would mitigate any significant adverse environmental effects of the project.

- **(3)** The scope of the factors to be considered under paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (d) shall be determined by the CPA.



**11** 

- **(1)** If the CPA is aware of any special circumstances of a project that would make the project of interest to the public or if public participation is required by any Act of Parliament or regulation made under it, the CPA shall give the public notice of the screening and shall give the public an opportunity to participate in the screening.

- **(2)** Before taking a course of action under subsection 15(1), if the CPA is aware of any special circumstances of a project that would make the project of interest to the public or if public participation is required by any Act of Parliament or regulation made under it, the CPA shall give the public notice of the screening and an opportunity to examine and comment on the screening report and on any record that has been filed in the public registry established in respect of the project in accordance with section 31.




## Model Class Screening Report
