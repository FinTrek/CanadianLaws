**14** 

- **(1)** If the Minister and the owner fail to agree on the extent of the partial loss or damage to, or on any consequent reduction in the fair market value of, the object or appurtenance, each shall select a competent appraiser or appraisers who shall independently consider the extent of the partial loss or damage and each determine any consequent reduction in the fair market value of the object or appurtenance.

- **(2)** If the Minister and the owner agree on the extent of the partial loss or damage and the consequent reduction in the fair market value of an object or appurtenance, based on the determinations of the appraisers made under subsection (1), the Minister shall act in accordance with subparagraph 12(b)(i) or (ii).

- **(3)** If the Minister and the owner continue to disagree on the extent of the partial loss or damage and the consequent reduction in the fair market value of an object or appurtenance the Minister and owner shall jointly select a competent and disinterested arbitrator to determine the matter.
