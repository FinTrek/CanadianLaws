- **(b)** where another company acquired all of the voting shares of the life company as a result of the conversion of the life company into a company with common shares and holds all of the voting shares of the life company at that time, no person has a significant interest in
	- **(i)** any class of shares of the other company, or
	- **(ii)** any class of non-voting shares of the life company.
