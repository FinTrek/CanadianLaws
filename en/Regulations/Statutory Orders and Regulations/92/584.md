----------

Whereas the United States is proposing to adopt a measure, set out in section 1706(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, as passed by the United States Congress on October 5, 1992, which affects section 515.559 of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R., Part 515, and constitutes a measure affecting trade or commerce between Canada and Cuba;

And Whereas, in the opinion of the Attorney General of Canada, that measure is likely to adversely affect significant Canadian interests in relation to trade or commerce between Canada and Cuba involving business carried on in whole or in part in Canada or is otherwise likely to infringe Canadian sovereignty;

Therefore, the Attorney General of Canada, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, pursuant to section 5 of the [Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/F/F-29.md), hereby revokes the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order (1990), made on October 31, 1990<sup><a href='#fn_1e'>[*]</a></sup>, and makes the annexed Order requiring persons in Canada to give notice of communications relating to, and prohibiting such persons from complying with, an extraterritorial measure of the United States that adversely affects trade or commerce between Canada and Cuba in substitution therefor.
