## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.

## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Kindersley Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2713 dated February 23, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 07-25 and are described as follows:

**(a)** surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 07 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295.0 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 25 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295.0 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.
