Date registered: 23 January 1992

----------

Whereas, pursuant to section 5.5 of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), a copy of the proposed Zoning Regulations respecting Coral Harbour Airport substantially in the form set out in the schedule hereto, was published in two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I on March 9th and 16th, 1991 and in two successive issues of News/North on June 24th and July 1st, 1991 and a reasonable opportunity was thereby afforded to interested persons to make representations to the Minister of Transport with respect thereto;

Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 5.4 of the [Aeronautics Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/A/A-2.md), is pleased hereby to make the annexed Regulations respecting zoning at Coral Harbour Airport.




## Short Title


**1** These Regulations may be cited as the Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations.




## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means the Coral Harbour Airport, in the vicinity of Coral Harbour, in the Northwest Territories; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 56 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 155T-335T distant 762 m from the threshold of runway 335T.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 155T-335T, and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 155T consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 335T consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 155T-335T, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 644 m in length.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Coral Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2730 dated June 16, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centered on the airport reference point.
