***airport*** means the Flin Flon Airport, in the vicinity of Flin Flon, in the Province of Manitoba; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***Minister*** means the Minister of Transport; (*ministre*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 296.0 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit such land or any part of it to be used for the disposal of any waste that is edible by or attractive to birds.

**(Sections 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 18-36 distant 762.0 m from the end of runway 18.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 18-36, and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 18 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75.0 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 36 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 40 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 3 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 525 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 75.0 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 18-36, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is 150 m in width, 75 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 644 m in length.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Flin Flon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2710 dated January 17, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centered on the airport reference point.
