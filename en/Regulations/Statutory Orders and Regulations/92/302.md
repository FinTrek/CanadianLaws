***year*** means a calendar year. (*année*)




## Application

- **(2)** These Regulations do not apply in respect of a foreign company that is authorized under the Act only to reinsure risks.




## Maximum Percentage of Reinsurance


**4** 

- **(1)** Subject to subsection (2), a foreign company shall not cause itself in any year to be reinsured against more than seventy-five per cent of the risks insured by it in its policies in Canada.

- **(2)** A foreign company that was registered under the Foreign Insurance Companies Act or the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act before January 1, 1990 that caused itself to be reinsured against more than seventy-five per cent of the risks insured by it in its policies in Canada in 1989 may cause itself in 1992 to be reinsured to an extent up to and including the lesser of
	- **(a)** eighty per cent of the risks insured by it in its policies in Canada in 1992, and
	- **(b)** the percentage of the risks insured by it in its policies in Canada against which it caused itself to be reinsured in 1989.




## Calculation of Percentage of Reinsurance


**5** The percentage of risks insured by a foreign company in its policies in Canada against which the foreign company causes itself to be reinsured in a year shall be calculated by multiplying 100 by the quotient obtained by dividing
- **(a)** the total premiums paid or payable by that foreign company in that year in respect of the reinsurance of the risks insured by that foreign company in its policies in Canada, without reduction in respect of commissions, expense allowances and other considerations received or receivable by that foreign company
by
- **(b)** the gross premium income of that foreign company for that year.




## Reinsurance with Non-approved Insurers


**6**

- **(2)** The percentage of risks insured by a foreign company in its policies in Canada against which the foreign company causes itself to be reinsured by non-approved insurers in a year shall be calculated by multiplying 100 by the quotient obtained by dividing
	- **(a)** the total premiums paid or payable by that foreign company in that year to non-approved insurers in respect of the reinsurance of the risks insured by that foreign company in its policies in Canada, without reduction in respect of commissions, expense allowances and other considerations received or receivable by that foreign company
by
	- **(b)** the gross premium income of that foreign company for that year.

- **(3)** Where, in accordance with subsection 4(2), a foreign company has caused itself to be reinsured against more than seventy-five per cent of the risks insured by it in its policies in Canada in 1992, the foreign company shall not cause itself to be reinsured by non-approved insurers in that year to an extent greater than the amount of the risks insured by it in its policies in Canada in that year against which it has not caused itself to be reinsured.




## Reinsurance Not in the Ordinary Course of Business


**7** For the purposes of section 5 and subsection 6(2), where the agreement by which a foreign company causes itself in any year to be reinsured against risks insured by it in its policies in Canada is not made in the ordinary course of its business, the total premiums referred to in paragraph 5(a) and 6(2)(a) and the gross premium income referred to in paragraph 5(b) and 6(2)(b) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the premiums paid or payable by the foreign company in that year under that agreement.
