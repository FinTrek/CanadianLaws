	- **(a)** an analysis of a sample of each batch of the defoamer indicates that the defoamer contains
		- **(i)** 40 ppb or less by weight of dibenzofuran, and
		- **(ii)** 10 ppb or less by weight of dibenzo-para-dioxin; or

		- **(ii)** 10 ppb or less by weight of dibenzo-para-dioxin.

- **(2)** No person shall manufacture, import, offer for sale or sell, for use in a mill in Canada that uses a chlorine bleaching process, a defoamer in which the concentration of
	- **(a)** dibenzofuran exceeds 40 ppb; or
	- **(b)** dibenzo-para-dioxin exceeds 10 ppb.

- **(3)** No person shall import, offer for sale or sell for use in a mill in Canada, or use in a mill in Canada, wood chips that have been made from wood that has been treated with polychlorinated phenols.
