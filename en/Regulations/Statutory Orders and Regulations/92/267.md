	- **(b)** proceed to annual sampling referred to in item 4, if the conditions required for annual sampling exist.

- **(2)** If an accelerated schedule is followed as described in subitem (1), item 6 applies to that sampling schedule.


**6** Where for any quarterly or annual samples there are measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD or measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDF, one 24-hour composite sample of the final effluent shall be collected monthly until no measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and no measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDF have been detected for the period set out in item 3 or 4 at which time that item applies.
