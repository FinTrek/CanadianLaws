***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 47.2 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described as follows:
- **(a)** the lands within the outer limits of lands described in Part VI of the Schedule; and
- **(b)** the lands directly under that portion of the approach surfaces that extend beyond the said outer limits.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




## Natural Growth


**5** Where an object of natural growth on any land to which these Regulations apply exceeds in elevation any of the surfaces referred to in paragraphs 4(a) to (c), the Minister may require that the owner or occupier of the land on which that object is growing remove the excessive growth.




## Disposal of Waste


**6** No owner or occupier of any land to which these Regulations apply shall permit such land or any part of it to be used for the disposal of any waste that is edible by or attractive to birds.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-3 to S-1857-6 inclusive, dated February 12, 1988, is determined by measuring l 200 m northerly along the centre line of runway 03-21 from the southerly end of runway 03 and thence measuring easterly at right angles from the said centre line, 300 m from the centre line of said runway. The said Airport Reference Point has Prince Edward Island Double Stereographic Grid Co-ordinates of N 293 283.042 m and E 690 665.396 m.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0 to S-1857-12 inclusive, dated February 12, 1988, are surfaces abutting each end of the strips associated with runways designated 03-21 and l0-28 and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 03 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip;



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 21 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 15 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip;



**(c)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach l0 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant l5 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(d)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 28 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 50 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant l5 000 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 2 400 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 300 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0, S-1857-2 to S-1857-6 inclusive, S-1857-8, S-1857-9 and S-1857-11, dated February 12, 1988, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strips

The strips shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0 and S-1857-3 to S-1857-6 inclusive, dated February 12, l988, are described as follows:

**(b)** the strip associated with runway 10-28 is 300 m in width, 150 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway and 2 253.6 m in length.





**PART V** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0 and S-1857-3 to S-1857-6 inclusive, dated February 12, 1988, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of each strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of each strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjoining strip.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Outer Limits

The boundary of the outer limits, shown on Charlottetown Airport Zoning Plan Nos. S-1857-0, S-1857-2 to S-1857-6 inclusive, S-1857-8, S-1857-9 and S-1857-11 dated February 12, l988, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
