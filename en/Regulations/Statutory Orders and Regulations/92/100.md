## Interpretation


**2** 

- **(1)** In these Regulations,

***airport*** means the Igloolik Airport, in the vicinity of Igloolik, in the Northwest Territories; (*aéroport*)

***airport reference point*** means the point described in Part I of the schedule; (*point de repère de l’aéroport*)

***approach surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from each end of a strip, which approach surface is more particularly described in Part II of the schedule; (*surface d’approche*)

***outer surface*** means an imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport, which outer surface is more particularly described in Part III of the schedule; (*surface extérieure*)

***strip*** means the rectangular portion of the landing area of the airport, including the runway, prepared for the take-off and landing of aircraft in a particular direction, which strip is more particularly described in Part IV of the schedule; (*bande*)

***transitional surface*** means an imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of a strip and its approach surfaces, which transitional surface is more particularly described in Part V of the schedule. (*surface de transition*)

- **(2)** For the purposes of these Regulations, the elevation of the airport reference point is 46.1 m above sea level.




## Application


**3** These Regulations apply to all the lands, including public road allowances, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, which lands are more particularly described in Part VI of the schedule.




## General


**4** No person shall erect or construct on any land to which these Regulations apply, any building, structure or object or any addition to any existing building, structure or object, the highest point of which will exceed in elevation at the location of that point
- **(a)** the approach surfaces;
- **(b)** the outer surface; or
- **(c)** the transitional surfaces.




### **SCHEDULE** 
**(Sections 2 and 3)**

**PART I** 
## Description of Airport Reference Point

The airport reference point shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is a point located on the centre line of runway 149-329 distant 579.0 m from the threshold of runway 149.



**PART II** 
## Description of the Approach Surfaces

The approach surfaces, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, are surfaces abutting each end of the strip associated with the runway designated 149-329, and are described as follows:

**(a)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 149 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip; and



**(b)** a surface abutting the end of the strip associated with runway approach 329 consisting of an inclined plane having a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 30 m measured horizontally rising to an imaginary horizontal line drawn at right angles to the projected centre line of the strip and distant 2 500 m measured horizontally from the end of the strip; the outer ends of the imaginary horizontal line being 295 m from the projected centre line; said imaginary horizontal line being 83.3 m above the elevation at the end of the strip.





**PART III** 
## Description of the Outer Surface

The outer surface, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is an imaginary surface located at a common plane established at a constant elevation of 45 m above the elevation of the airport reference point, except that, where that common plane is less than 9 m above the surface of the ground, the outer surface is an imaginary surface located at 9 m above the surface of the ground.



**PART IV** 
## Description of the Strip

The strip associated with runway 149-329, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is 90 m in width, 45 m being on each side of the centre line of the runway, and 1 278 m in length.



**PART V** 
## Description of Each Transitional Surface

Each transitional surface, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is a surface consisting of an inclined plane rising at a ratio of 1 m measured vertically to 7 m measured horizontally at right angles to the centre line and projected centre line of the strip and extending upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip and its approach surfaces to an intersection with the outer surface.



**PART VI** 
## Description of the Lands to Which These Regulations Apply

The boundary of the outer limits of lands, shown on Igloolik Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2731 dated June 19, 1989, is a circle with a radius of 4 000 m centred on the airport reference point.
