### **SCHEDULE** 
**1** *Claims by Canadians*

**(a)** Where a claim is made for maltreatment and the person who suffered the maltreatment was at the time when the maltreatment occurred a member of the armed forces of Canada, the claimant shall be deemed to have been a Canadian both at the time of the maltreatment and at the time of presentation of the claim.



**(b)** For the purpose of determining whether a corporation is a Canadian at any relevant time, of the three tests recommended by the Advisory Commission on War Claims, those as to residence and trading only are retained and the test relating to ownership of outstanding securities is deleted.



**(c)** A corporation regarded as having had residence both in Canada and outside of Canada at any relevant time may be treated as at that time having had Canadian residence only if it then was incorporated in Canada.




**2** *Maltreatment*

**(a)** In respect of the European Theatre:

Where a person has been in the direct custody of members of an organization declared a criminal organization by the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg (such organization being the SS, SD, Gestapo and Leadership Corps), and is ineligible for an award under the Sumner Commission test, he may, if held in such custody for a period of fourteen days or more, be awarded one dollar per diem for each day of such custody, but should such custody have been for less than fourteen days any award on a per diem basis shall be within the discretion of the War Claims Commission. The receipt of or the eligibility for a pension under the [Pension Act](/en/Acts/Revised%20Statutes%20of%20Canada/P/P-6.md) for disability consequent upon maltreatment shall not be taken into account in determining eligibility for or the amount of a per diem award or a lump sum award for maltreatment.





**(b)** In respect of the Far Eastern Theatre:

Maltreatment awards at the rate of one dollar per diem to or in respect of former prisoners of war of the Japanese eligible therefor under the Report of the Advisory Commission on War Claims may be paid in a lump sum as in the case of such awards to or in respect of civilians, and such payments shall include any benefit for which the recipients may be eligible pursuant to Article 16 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan.





**(c)** Surviving awards — civilian claims:

Where there is a valid death claim in addition to a claim for maltreatment the accrual of the benefits of the maltreatment award to the widow, dependent husband, child, children, dependent parent or parents of the deceased as the case may be, shall not be taken into account in determining the pecuniary loss which he, she, or they, have suffered from the death.





**(d)** Surviving awards — dependents of service personnel:

Where maltreatment caused death but there is no valid death claim because the deceased was a prisoner of war and pension is payable on account of his death, the maltreatment award payable to the widow, dependent husband, child, children or other dependent shall be paid to such dependent notwithstanding the fact that such dependent is in receipt of a pension in respect of the death, and without any deduction on account of such pension.





**(e)** Additional payments:

There may be paid to every person to or in respect of whom, on or prior to the coming into force of this paragraph, payment of a maltreatment award was authorized to be made, an additional amount equal to fifty per cent of the maltreatment award so authorized, but if that person is dead, the additional amount shall be paid to such person as the Treasury Board designates.





**(f)** Increases in rates:

In their application to persons to or in respect of whom no payment of a maltreatment award was authorized on or prior to the coming into force of this paragraph but who may be eligible to receive such an award, paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be read and construed as if for the words “one dollar” there were substituted the words “one dollar and fifty cents”.

**(a)** For property losses

**8** In any case where a payment in respect of a war claim may be or could have been made to a person, or to another on his behalf, from a source other than the War Claims Fund and where the War Claims Commissioner is of opinion that undue delay would result from postponement of his recommendation until he could assess with reasonable certainty the possibilities of recovery of compensation from such other source, he may make his recommendation immediately on the basis of the information then available.
